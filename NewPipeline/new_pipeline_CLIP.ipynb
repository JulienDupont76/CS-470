Elon Musk News: Entrepreneur to Step Back from DOGE Elon Musk is ready to start spending less time in Washington D.C. The entrepreneur told Wall Street analysts on April 22 that he would be “significantly” his work with the Department of Government Efficiency to focus more on Tesla. Beginning in May, the 53-year-old will only work for DOGE per week “for as long as the president would like me to do so.” This decision comes amid a drastic plummet in Tesla’s sales, with the company’s latest quarterly earnings report showing a 71 percent drop in profits. The electric vehicle company has been the target of widespread protests and boycotts in recent months, largely in response to Musk’s role in DOGE’s elimination of thousands of federal jobs. While reassuring investors about his commitment to Tesla, he also addressed the impact that tariffs could have on the cost of their cars, that his position differs from President ’s recent moves. “I’ll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said. “That’s all I can do.” Companies: SpaceX, Tesla, Twitter, and More Personal Life: Religion, Asperger’s Syndrome, and More Elon Musk is the founder of SpaceX and Tesla Motors, among other companies. Their success has propelled him to become the richest person in the world, with a net worth greater than $335 billion. The South African–born entrepreneur started his first businesses in the 1990s: an online city guide called Zip2 and a digital payment company named X.com, which later became PayPal. Musk, who became an American citizen in 2002, then moved into the transportation industry via his most recognizable companies. He diversified his holdings in 2022 by purchasing Twitter, which he renamed X. A vehement supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, Musk is head of the Department of Government Efficiency, the headline-grabbing advisory group under Trump’s second administration. Beyond his professional life, Musk is a father to SPOUSES: Justine Wilson (2000–2008) and Talulah Riley (2010–12; 2013–16) CHILDREN: Nevada, Vivian, Griffin, Kai, Saxon, Damian, X Æ A-Xii, Strider, Azure, Exa, Techno, Arcadia, Seldon, and R.S.C. Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. His mother, , is a Canadian model and the oldest woman to star in a CoverGirl campaign. When Elon was growing up, she worked five jobs at one point to support her family. Elon’s father, Errol Musk, is a wealthy South African engineer. Elon spent his early childhood with his brother, Kimbal, and sister, Tosca, in South Africa. His parents divorced when he was 10. Around this time, Musk developed an interest in computers and taught himself how to program. When he was 12 years old, Musk developed his own game called that he sold for $500. He was often so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing. The short, introverted, and bookish child was bullied until he was 15. By that point, he went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and wrestling. He has continued to At age 17, in 1988, Elon moved to Canada against his parents’ wishes to attend university and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. He obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain U.S. citizenship via that path. Elon moved to the United States a few years later and officially became an American citizen in 2002. “I came to North America because I felt this was where there was opportunity to do great things in technology,” Musk’s move to Canada coincided with his enrollment in Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. He studied there for two years before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania in 1992. He graduated five years later with bachelor’s degrees in economics and physics. Musk then headed to Stanford University to pursue a doctorate in energy physics. However, his relocation to California was timed perfectly with the internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days in favor of joining the rising tech wave. Companies: SpaceX, Tesla, Twitter, and More Now one of his most recognizable entities, SpaceX was the third company Elon Musk founded. Musk launched his first company while he was still in college. Today, he leads several businesses, including SpaceX, Tesla Motors, and social media site X (previously Twitter). His current and past ventures include: The soon-to-be serial entrepreneur launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his brother, Kimbal. An online city guide, Zip2 was soon providing content for the new websites of . In 1999, a division of Compaq Computer Corporation bought Zip2 for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options. The Musk brothers immediately used the money from Zip2’s sale to found X.com, an online financial services and payments company. The following year, in 2000, X.com merged with a similar company businessman Peter Thiel had founded. Elon briefly served as CEO before being pushed out. Thiel assumed leadership and renamed the company PayPal. Musk founded his third company—Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX—in 2002 with the intention of building spacecraft for commercial space travel. A key tenet of the Texas-based company and its research has been improving the sustainability of spacecraft in an effort to save costs on space travel. , its Falcon 9 is the first orbital class rocket capable of reflight. It can be reused more than 10 times, with decreased maintenance between flights. Elsewhere, the company recently in which its first-stage booster returned to the launchpad shortly following takeoff. SpaceX was well established by 2008 when NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station in a move to replace the U.S. government’s own space shuttle missions. Plans for SpaceX to takeover future astronaut transport were also drawn up. The company continues to receive government contracts today. On May 22, 2012, SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket into space with an unmanned Dragon capsule. The Dragon was sent to the ISS with 1,000 pounds of supplies for the astronauts stationed there, marking the first time a private company had sent a spacecraft to the space station. “I feel very lucky,” Musk said about the launch. “For us, it’s like winning the Super Bowl.” SpaceX has since made more than 20 cargo deliveries to the ISS. Its Falcon 9 rockets have also carried satellites into orbit, including one designed to observe the sun’s extreme emissions that affect power grids and communications systems on Earth. Many satellites are part of the company’s Starlink internet service. Another historic milestone arrived on May 30, 2020, when two NASA astronauts aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon from Kennedy Space Center on a Falcon 9 rocket. It was the first time an American crew launched from U.S. soil in a commercially built American spacecraft to go to the ISS. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine called the achievement an “important step on our path to expand human exploration to the Moon and Mars.” Beyond these missions, SpaceX has continued to build out its fleet of rockets and spacecraft. Newer iterations of the Falcon 9 have been developed over the years. The company also now has a Falcon Heavy rocket, armed with three Falcon 9 engine cores, that’s designed to carry immense payloads into orbit and potentially serve as a vehicle for deep space missions. An even bigger engineering project began around 2016. The BFR, an acronym for Big Falcon Rocket or Big F––ing Rocket, was initially conceived as 42-engine behemoth topped by a spaceship capable of carrying at least 100 people. A next-generation BFR was in 2019 with the name Starship. The current design includes a Starship spacecraft and a Super Heavy rocket outfitted with 33 Raptor engines. Test flights began in April 2023. Starlink, a division of SpaceX, is a satellite network that has made broadband internet service more accessible in rural areas and has boosted competition in heavily populated markets that are typically dominated by one or two providers. After receiving permission from the U.S. government to launch a fleet of satellites into low orbit in late March 2018, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites in May 2019. Another payload of 60 satellites followed that November. According to from the the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics from July 2024, Starlink is now responsible for about 60 percent of the more than 10,000 active satellites in orbit. The company has short-term plans to increase its total to more than 12,000. The appearance of these bright orbiters in the night sky has worried some astronomers who feel a proliferation of satellites increases the difficulty of studying distant objects in space. Even so, Starlink’s impact on Earth is apparent. In May 2024, that more than 3 million customers in 99 countries rely on the internet provider. Its materials have also collect intelligence and coordinate drone attacks during its ongoing war with Russia. Musk is the cofounder, CEO, and product architect at Tesla Motors, a company formed in 2003 that is dedicated to producing affordable, mass-market electric cars as well as battery products and solar roofs. Musk oversees all product development, engineering, and design of the Texas-based company’s products. In the two-plus decades since its formation, Tesla has unveiled a series of electric vehicles at multiple price points, including some with self-driving capabilities. The first was the Roadster, a sports car launched in 2008 with a travel range of nearly 250 miles between charges of its lithium-ion battery. It’s capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds. The Tesla lineup now includes the Model S and the more affordable Model 3 sedans, the Model X and Model Y crossover SUVs, and the Cybertruck. Boasting a 265-mile range, the first-generation Model S was named the 2013 Car of the Year by or about 75 percent of electric vehicle sales in the United States, but its share dipped to as little as 49 percent by the second quarter of 2024. This is partly due to repeated production issues, safety concerns, and company downsizing. It took four years for the Model S to enter production after it was first announced in August 2008. The Model 3 was delayed three times before arriving to market in early 2019, and its production problems ultimately prompted Musk to personally oversee engineering efforts at Tesla. Similarly, the Cybertruck was first introduced in November 2019. When the electric pickup finally became available in November 2023, the cost had increased around $21,000. Delays haven’t been the only issue to plague the Cybertruck, whose “cyberpunk” style was inspired by the movies by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety, and concerns rose about the lack of crush zones on the vehicle body. This means passengers might feel higher impacts in the event of an accident. In August 2024, two separate incidents occurred in Texas in which the vehicles caught fire— one of which killed the driver . As of November 2024, Tesla has initiated six recalls for the Cybertruck , and the vehicle is the subject of at least four NHTSA investigations into possible safety defects. Amid these challenges, Tesla has navigated several significant layoffs. In 2018, Musk announced 9 percent of its workforce would be let go. The company has in more recent years, reportedly losing as much as 14 percent of its workforce in 2024 alone. Tesla continues working on the Semi, a new commercial truck, and the second-generation Roadster that the company promises to be the fastest-accelerating production car with a 0-to-60 time of . Both projects were unveiled in November 2017 and are still not on the market as of December 2024. Solar panel manufacturer SolarCity, now a part of Tesla Motors, was founded by two of Musk’s cousins in 2006. Musk invested in the company and served as its board chairman. In 2016, in his continuing effort to promote and advance sustainable energy and products for a wider consumer base, Musk announced Tesla would buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion in an all-stock deal. The acquisition, completed in November 2016, placed Musk in hot water when some Tesla shareholders filed a lawsuit alleging the deal was unfair and claiming Musk had acted in his own interest, not Tesla’s. A Delaware Chancery Court judge in favor of Musk in 2022, determining he hadn’t acted outside his fiduciary duty. That decision was by the state supreme court in June 2023. In January 2017, Musk launched The Boring Company that’s devoted to boring and building tunnels as a way to reduce street traffic. Like many of his other companies, its headquarters are in Texas. Musk began with a test dig on SpaceX property in Los Angeles. In late October 2017, Musk posted the first photo of his company’s progress to his Instagram page. He said the 500-foot tunnel, which would generally run parallel to Interstate 405, would reach a length of two miles in approximately four months. In May 2019, the company, now known as TBC, landed a $48.7 million contract from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority to build an underground Loop system to shuttle people around the Las Vegas Convention Center. The Loop and has transported more than 1.5 million visitors. That project came after an ultimately unsuccessful effort to build and operate a high-speed rail line in Chicago. After then-Chicago Mayor asked for proposals in November 2017 for rail lines between O’Hare Airport and downtown Chicago that would take 20 minutes or less, Musk tweeted that he was all-in on the competition with The Boring Company. In summer 2018, Musk announced he would cover the estimated $1 billion needed to dig the 17-mile tunnel. However, in late 2019, he tweeted TBC would focus on completing the commercial tunnel in Las Vegas before turning to other projects. In a one-off stunt, Musk announced The Boring Company would make flamethrowers about a year into its founding. After sharing that they were going on sale for $500 apiece in late January 2018, he claimed to have sold 10,000 of them within a day. Buying Twitter and Conversion to X In January 2022, Musk began investing in social media site Twitter. Within two months, he became the company’s largest shareholder with a stake of more than 9 percent. On April 15, Musk made an , valuing the company at around $43 billion . “I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy.” . “Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.” Despite the company’s initial acceptance, a months-long dispute over the sale ensued during which Musk threatened to terminate the deal given the prevalence of bots and fake accounts on the platform. Finally in October 2022, Musk officially and became the social media company’s CEO. The transition drew backlash, as Twitter announced early that November it had begun that would affect roughly half of its 7,500-person workforce. Musk additionally introduced a subscription-based verification service, which had previously been awarded to notable accounts for free as a form of authentication. as the new CEO, and a few weeks later in July, the site rebranded as X and shed its bird-themed logo. The company is based in Bastrop, Texas. While the site now serves as one of Musk’s primary communication outlets, its value has steeply declined since the purchase. , the investment company Fidelity estimated the value of X had dropped 80 percent by October 2024. At least 30 lawsuits have been filed against X for refusal to pay former employees and vendors, In January 2025, Yaccarino announced that Visa will partner with X to offer a digital payment service. The move coincides with of having X became an “everything app.” Then, in March, Musk X to his artificial intelligence startup xAI in an all-stock deal valued at $33 billion. “This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” he said. Musk has pursued an interest in artificial intelligence initially by cofounding the nonprofit OpenAI. The research company launched in late 2015 with the stated mission of advancing digital intelligence to benefit humanity. Two years later, Musk left the company and his post as co-chair following an internal dispute, which led to Sam Altman becoming CEO. OpenAI has since launched the popular chat software ChatGPT, which went live in 2022. the formation of xAI. Now headquartered in San Francisco, the company’s is to “advance our collective understanding of the universe” through artificial intelligence programs. The xAI Grok model was introduced to premium users on X starting that December. In May 2024, the AI startup announced it had attracted in investments. The following March, xAI acquired Musk’s social media site, X, in a $33 billion all-stock deal. Despite xAI’s growth, Musk is still paying mind to OpenAI. In August 2024, the now-rival company, alleging OpenAI betrayed its founding purpose of benefitting the public good in favor of becoming a for-profit business. The ongoing case went to federal court that December. Separately, Musk joined a group of investors in offering to buy OpenAI in February 2025; CEO Altman rejected the lowball offer. Through SpaceX and Tesla, Musk has achieved notable advancements in sustainable space exploration as well as driverless transportation with the research and launch of Full Self-Driving software . Musk has brought this pioneering spirit to other ventures but with mixed results.  Among the inventions Musk has spent the most time and money to research are a new high-speed public transportation system and biological software connectivity. In August 2013, Musk released a concept for a new form of transportation called the “Hyperloop” that would would propel riders in pods through a network of low-pressure tubes at speeds reaching more than 700 mph. He proposed the transit system be built between San Francisco and Los Angeles, an endeavor that the inventor noted could take from seven to 10 years to be built and ready for use. He suggested the Hyperloop run on renewable energy. Elon Musk Was the Model for Passing off the concept to fellow entrepreneurs, a startup formed to pursue the Hyperloop in 2014. For a time, it was owned by British entrepreneur reported the company began to sell off its assets and lay off remaining employees. In 2017, it was reported that Musk was backing a venture called Neuralink, which intended to create devices to be implanted in the human brain and help people merge with software. Its devices consist of a microscopic chip that connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone or computer. Concerns over the project arose in 2023, when that monkeys receiving the implant in tests suffered “debilitating heath defects” including paralysis and brain swelling. Musk downplayed any risks, saying that only “terminal” monkeys received the implant and that none had died from the experiments. In January 2024, Neuralink completed its first implant in a human subject , with Musk saying the results showed promise. A year later, the businessman reported there are now three people with Neuralink implants, and he hopes 20 to 30 more people will join them in 2025. Musk is the richest person in the world, a title he has held at various points since early 2021. He regularly swaps spots with Amazon founder and French businessman Bernard Arnault, who is the founder and CEO of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. , Musk is worth $389 billion as of April 29, 2025. is lower, totaling Musk’s fortune at $335 billion. Because much of his net worth is tied up in stock, Musk’s wealth is highly variable. The 15 Richest Actors in the World What Is Soccer Star Cristiano Ronaldo’s Net Worth? Breaking Down Michael Jordan's Record-Setting Net Worth A large portion of Musk’s wealth stems from his shares and options in Tesla, which the to be around $120 billion as of June 2024. That number is almost certainly even higher now as Tesla’s value has grown significantly since. Musk’s first major financial windfall came via the sale of Zip2 in 1999, which earned him $22 million for his stake. He invested that money into X.com, which turned into a $165 million sum following eBay’s purchase of the renamed PayPal in 2002 and allowed Musk to earn his first billion. to boast a net worth of $400 billion or more in December 2024. reported the entrepreneur’s net worth grew by more than $200 billion that year. The unprecedented feat followed Musk’s historic milestone of becoming the first person to lose $200 billion Although Musk is currently single, he has been married three times to two women and has 13 living children. His firstborn died as an infant. In 2000, the entrepreneur wed Justine Wilson, who then changed her last name to Musk. They met as students at Queen’s University. In 2002, their first son, Nevada, died at 10 weeks old from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The loss didn’t prevent them from growing their family later on. Elon and Justine welcomed twins, Griffin and Vivian, in 2004 followed by triplets—Kai, Saxon, and Damian—in two years later. All five children were conceived through in vitro fertilization. Vivian is transgender and legally changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson in 2022. She doesn’t wish to be associated with Elon in any way. In a 2024 interview with , she called her father “uncaring and narcissistic” and said he was cruel to her as a child for being queer. Ultimately, Elon and Justine’s marriage broke down. Their contentious divorce was finalized in 2008. Elon Musk and actor Talulah Riley have been married and divorced twice. Musk met actor Talulah Riley after his first marriage collapsed. Today, she is best known for her roles in the 2005 movie Musk and Riley married in 2010 but split by 2012. They decided to marry again in 2013, but their relationship ultimately ended in a second divorce in 2016. Musk reportedly began dating actor Amber Heard in 2016 after finalizing his second divorce with Riley and following Heard’s divorce from actor . Their busy schedules caused Musk and Heard to break up in August 2017. The couple got back together in January 2018 and split again one month later. Elon Musk and Grimes attend the Met Gala in May 2018. In May 2018, Musk began dating musician Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher. That month, Grimes announced she had changed her name to “ ,” the symbol for the speed of light, reportedly at the encouragement of Musk. Fans criticized the feminist performer for dating a billionaire whose company had been described as a “predator zone” amid accusations of sexual harassment. However, the couple discussed their love for one another in a March 2019 feature in the ’s wild fae artistic creativity and hyper-intense work ethic.” Grimes gave birth to their first son in early May 2020, with Musk announcing they named the boy X Æ A-12. The name was partly inspired by the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft. Later in the month, after it was reported that the State of California wouldn’t accept a name with a number, the couple said they were changing their son’s name to X Æ A-Xii. a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, in December 2021. The child was delivered via a surrogate. In September 2023, journalist Walter Isaacson revealed in , a son named Techno Mechanicus and nicknamed “Tau.” in March 2022 that she and Musk had broken up. During his relationship with Grimes, Musk quietly welcomed two children, a son named Strider and a daughter named Azure, with Shivon Zilis in November 2021. Zilis is the project director of his Neuralink company. Since then, she has had two more children with Musk. Their daughter Arcadia was born in February 2024, and they have another son named Seldon. reports Zilis and the kids live on a compound in Austin, Texas, that Musk helped purchase. The property includes two mansions and is close to a third home Musk regularly stays at when he’s in town. A day after the article was published, the entrepreneur told he didn’t own and isn’t building such a compound. In February 2025, conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair announced she had a brief romantic relationship with Musk that resulted in a baby boy, whose name is Romulus. Musk hasn’t confirmed his role as the boy’s father, though a paternity test confirmed he is. The would-be co-parents are currently in a custody lawsuit, as St. Clair is seeking full custody. After Donald Trump was elected U.S. president in 2016, Musk found himself on common ground with the incoming commander-in-chief and his advisers as Trump announced plans to pursue massive infrastructure developments. That December, Musk was named to the president-elect’s Strategy and Policy Forum. Further solidifying their collaboration, he joined Trump’s Manufacturing Jobs Initiative in January 2017. While sometimes at odds with the president’s controversial measures, such as a ban on immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, Musk defended his involvement with the new administration. “My goals,” he tweeted in early 2017, “are to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization, a consequence of which will be the creating of hundreds of thousands of jobs and a more inspiring future for all.” in June 2017 that he was withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate accord, Musk stepped down from his advisory roles. Elon Musk, who had served as an advisor in President Donald Trump’s first administration, took an active role in the Republican candidate’s 2024 reelection campaign. Despite their uneven relationship during Trump’s first administration, Musk endorsed the Republican nominee for president in the 2024 election against Vice President . Following an attempted assassination of Trump at a rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024, Musk said he would for another rally at the same location in October. Later that month, Musk announced he would randomly give away $1 million dollars each day to a person who signed a petition from his political action committee supporting the Constitution as part of an effort to register voters who might support Trump. The giveaway became the subject of in Pennsylvania alleging it could improperly influence the November 5 election, but Musk’s lawyers argued that recipients were not actually chosen randomly, and a judge allowed the prizes to continue. Trump ultimately won a second term as president. Musk had an up-close view of Trump’s inauguration come January 2025 and even spoke at a modified Presidential Parade, held indoors like the rest of the inaugural events on account of extreme cold. During his brief remarks, he made a straight-arm salute that caused controversy as some people likened it to the Nazi salute. The president quickly appointed Musk to lead a temporary organization called the Department of Government Efficiency that works to cut unnecessary federal spending and modernize technology within the federal government. Trump has granted DOGE 18 months to accomplish its mission before disbanding in early July 2026. “Elon Musk is a once in a generation business leader, and our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency,” a Trump transition team DOGE has been quick to announce deep cuts that have impacted more than 30 federal departments and agencies. Around 131,100 government employees have taken buyouts or been laid off, per . Other downsizing has taken shape in the cancellation of contracts, grants, and office leases. Per its official website, DOGE estimates the measures are saving . However, critics have pointed holes in the calculation, noting that some figures included in the total are contracts already set to expire, for example. The activity has prompted a slew of lawsuits, some regarding the constitutionality of the cuts, as well as backlash against Musk, who the White House has said is a senior presidential advisor and not the official DOGE administrator in court filings. Protestors have taken to demonstrating at or vandalizing Tesla showrooms, and some car owners are seeking to sell their models to distance themselves from the controversial billionaire. In April 2025, Musk revealed he would be scaling back his work with DOGE to focus on Tesla after the company’s profits took a dive. Starting in May, the Tesla CEO will only spend one to two days per week working for the government. Not entirely surprising for the CEO of major public companies, Musk has at times faced scrutiny over his business decisions as well as his own investments. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the entrepreneur in 2018 after he floated the possibility of making Tesla a private company. Several years later, in 2025, the SEC filed a ongoing lawsuit against Musk concerning his shares in Twitter prior to purchasing the now-private company and renaming it. Prior to his purchase of the site, Twitter was the genesis of a financial scandal involving Musk. On August 7, 2018, Musk dropped a bombshell via a tweet: “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” The announcement opened the door for legal action against the company and its founder, as the SEC began inquiring about whether Musk had indeed secured the funding as claimed. Several investors filed lawsuits on the grounds that Musk was looking to manipulate stock prices and ambush short sellers with his tweet. Musk’s tweet initially sent Tesla stock spiking, before it closed the day up 11 percent. The CEO followed up with a letter on the company blog, calling the move to go private “the best path forward.” He promised to retain his stake in the company and added that he would create a special fund to help all current investors remain on board. Six days later, Musk sought to clarify his position with a statement in which he pointed to discussions with the managing director of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund as the source of his “funding secured” declaration. He later tweeted that he was working on a proposal to take Tesla private with Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake as financial advisers. On August 24, one day after meeting with the board, Musk announced that he had reversed course and wouldn’t be taking the company private. Among his reasons, he cited the preference of most directors to keep Tesla public, as well as the difficulty of retaining some of the large shareholders who were prohibited from investing in a private company. On September 29, 2018, it was announced that Musk would pay a $20 million fine and step down as chairman of Tesla’s board for three years as part of an agreement with the SEC. More than six year later, in January 2025, the SEC Musk for allegedly failing to disclose his large stake in X in 2022, before he purchased the social media site then known as Twitter. The ongoing federal lawsuit contends that Musk committed securities fraud by not disclosing that he owned more than 5 percent of Twitter’s shares until 11 days after the report was due, him to buy stock in the company at “artificially low prices.” According to the SEC, the Tesla and SpaceX founder underpaid investors by $150 million for the additional shares he bought after surpassing the 5 percent ownership threshold. “Had Musk and his wealth manager disclosed his ownership as required, the stock price would likely have increased significantly,” the suit reads. In its complaint, the SEC that the court order Musk to pay “disgorgement of his unjust enrichment” as well as a civil penalty. Musk  responded to the filing in , calling the SEC a “totally broken organization” that is spending their time on him “when there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished.” Personal Life: Religion, Asperger’s Syndrome, and More Beyond his work and family lives, Musk is an avid video game player. Biographer Walter Isaacson, who released an authorized in 2023, even classified the hobby as He is a big fan of “the most beautiful art I’ve ever seen.” Isaacson’s biography about Musk, which was a No. 1 bestseller, is currently in the process of becoming a biopic. Director Darren Aronofsky is attached to the movie. “Glad Darren is doing it,” Musk after news about the project broke in late 2023. “He is one of the best.” In May 2020, Musk claimed in a series of social media posts he planned to sell nearly all of his physical possessions. , this eventually spurred Musk to sell multiple properties and make a $50,000 rental home in Boca Chica, Texas, his primary residence. The house is located near SpaceX’s development and testing site. In May 2021, Musk revealed while hosting an episode of the sketch comedy show , a developmental disorder that can cause difficulty with socialization and communication as well as obsessive interest in very specific topics. He elaborated further about his experience growing up with the condition a year later. “I would just tend to take things very literally… but then that turned out to be wrong—[people were not] simply saying exactly what they mean, there’s all sorts of other things that are meant, and [it] took me a while to figure that out,” Although long considered an atheist, Musk said in 2024 he considers himself a “cultural Christian” and believes in the teachings of —even though he might not follow all tenets of the faith. “I do believe that the teachings of Jesus are good and wise,” in an interview with psychologist and podcast host Jordan Peterson. This notable shift has coincided with Musk’s growing support of conservative political causes. He criticized lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and has used social media to amplify his beliefs related to free speech. , he has shared memes and sometimes misinformation on X about topics such as illegal immigration, alleged U.S. election fraud, and transgender policies. In broader terms, the boundless potential of space exploration and the preservation of the future of the human race have become the cornerstones of Musk’s abiding interests, and toward these, he has founded the Musk Foundation, which is dedicated to space exploration and the discovery of renewable and clean energy sources. In October 2019, Musk pledged to donate $1 million to the #TeamTrees campaign, which aims to plant 20 million trees around the world by 2020. He even changed his Twitter name to Treelon for the occasion. Musk has also been vocal about his concerns over a looming world population collapse caused by lower birth rates, calling it a “bigger risk to civilization than global warming.” However, many demographers have disagreed with his assessment.

Trevor Cokley—U.S. Air Force/U.S. Department of Defense Chief Justice agrees to pause court orders requiring DOGE to turn over records about its operation May 23, 2025, 5:59 PM ET Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. Where did Elon Musk go to school? in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and then transferred to the in Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees in physics and economics in 1997. He began graduate school in physics at but left after several days to focus on being an entrepreneur. Elon Musk cofounded the electronic payment firm , and in 2002 he founded , a company that makes rockets and spacecraft. He was a major early funder of , which makes electric cars and batteries, and became its chief executive officer in 2008. He cofounded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company, in 2016. Musk purchased the social media service Twitter in 2022 and renamed it , maker of launch vehicles and . He was also one of the first significant investors in, as well as . Musk is the world’s richest person, with a net worth of $393 billion, as of 2025. Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He displayed an early talent for and entrepreneurship. At age 12 he created a and sold it to a computer magazine. In 1988, after obtaining a Canadian passport, Musk left South Africa because he was unwilling to support and because he sought the greater economic opportunities available in the in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to the , Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees in in 1997. He enrolled in graduate school in physics at , but he left after only two days because he felt that the had much more potential to change society than work in physics. In 1995 he founded , a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer for $307 million, and Musk then founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized in transferring money online. The online auction bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Musk was long convinced that for life to survive, humanity has to become a multiplanet species. However, he was dissatisfied with the great expense of launchers. In 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets. Its first two rockets were the 1 (first launched in 2006) and the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010), which were designed to cost much less than competing rockets. A third rocket, the (first launched in 2018), was designed to carry 117,000 pounds (53,000 kg) to orbit, nearly twice as much as its largest competitor, the ’s Delta IV Heavy, for one-third the cost. The Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy eventually dominated the market, and in 2024 more than half of the world’s orbital launches were done by SpaceX. Video released by spacecraft maker SpaceX celebrating its Dragon capsule, which on May 25, 2012, became the first commercial spacecraft to dock with the International Space Station. SpaceX has announced the successor to the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy: the Super Heavy–Starship system. The Super Heavy first stage would be capable of lifting 100,000 kg (220,000 pounds) to . The payload would be the Starship, a spacecraft designed for providing fast between cities on Earth and building bases on the Moon and Mars. spacecraft, which carries supplies to the (ISS). Dragon can carry as many as seven astronauts, and it had a crewed flight carrying astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the ISS in 2020. The first test flights of the Super Heavy–Starship system launched in 2020. In addition to being CEO of SpaceX, Musk was also chief designer in building the Falcon rockets, Dragon, and Starship. SpaceX is contracted to build the lander for the astronauts returning to the Moon by 2026 as part of satellite network, which provides Internet service. As of 2025 there are about 7,000 working Starlink satellites, accounting for more than half of all active satellites. Starlink is a , or satellite Internet constellation, with more than three million subscribers as of 2024. Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in 2004 he became one of the major funders of (later renamed Tesla), an electric car company founded by entrepreneurs . In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car, the , which could travel 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most previous electric vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting, it was a sports car that could go from 0 to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in less than four seconds. In 2010 the company’s raised about $226 million. Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan, which was acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance and design. The company won further praise for its Model X luxury SUV, which went on the market in 2015. The Model 3, a less-expensive vehicle, went into production in 2017 and became the best-selling electric car of all time. Tesla announced several models to be released early in the 2020s, including a semitrailer truck (the Tesla Semi) and a pickup truck, the Cybertruck. Although the Cybertruck was slated for production in 2021, supply chain disruptions, design, and production issues pushed its rollout back two years. By the time Tesla began making Cybertruck deliveries in late 2023, it boasted a reservation backlog of two million vehicles, despite the boxy angular design that excited controversy when it was first unveiled. Dissatisfied with the projected cost ($68 billion) of a system in California, Musk in 2013 proposed an alternate faster system, the , a pneumatic tube in which a pod carrying 28 passengers would travel the 350 miles (560 km) between in 35 minutes at a top speed of 760 miles (1,220 km) per hour, nearly the . Musk claimed that the Hyperloop would cost only $6 billion and that, with the pods departing every two minutes on average, the system could accommodate the six million people who travel that route every year. However, he stated, between running SpaceX and Tesla, he could not devote time to the Hyperloop’s development. Does social media spur digital addiction and other ills? in 2009, and, as @elonmusk, he became one of the most popular accounts on the site, with more than 85 million followers as of 2022. He expressed reservations about Tesla’s being publicly traded, and in August 2018 he made a series of tweets about taking the company private at a value of $420 per share, noting that he had “secured funding.” (The value of $420 was seen as a joking reference to April 20, a day celebrated by devotees of .) The following month the U.S. (SEC) sued Musk for securities fraud, alleging that the tweets were “false and misleading.” Shortly thereafter Tesla’s board rejected the SEC’s proposed settlement, reportedly because Musk had threatened to resign. However, the news sent Tesla stock plummeting, and a harsher deal was ultimately accepted. Its terms included Musk’s stepping down as for three years, though he was allowed to continue as CEO; his tweets were to be preapproved by Tesla lawyers, and fines of $20 million for both Tesla and Musk were levied. Musk was critical of Twitter’s commitment to principles of , in light of the company’s content-moderation policies. Early in April 2022, Twitter’s filings with the SEC disclosed that Musk had bought more than 9 percent of the company. Shortly thereafter Twitter announced that Musk would join the company’s board, but Musk decided against that and made a bid for the entire company, at a value of $54.20 a share, for $44 billion. Twitter’s board accepted the deal, which would make him sole owner of the company. Musk stated that his plans for the company included “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.” In July 2022 Musk announced that he was withdrawing his bid, stating that Twitter had not provided sufficient information about bot accounts and claiming that the company was in “material breach of multiple provisions” of the purchase agreement. Bret Taylor, the chair of Twitter’s board of directors, responded by saying that the company was “committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk.” Twitter sued Musk to force him to buy the company. In September 2022 Twitter’s shareholders voted to accept Musk’s offer. Facing a legal battle, Musk ultimately proceeded with the deal, and it was completed in October. Among Musk’s first acts as Twitter’s owner were to lay off about half the company and to allow users to purchase for $8 a month the blue check-mark verification, which had previously been bestowed by Twitter upon notable figures. In addition, he disbanded Twitter’s content-moderation body and reinstated many banned accounts, most notably that of former U.S. president , which had been suspended after the U.S. Capitol attack on January 6, 2021 . Advertising revenue fell sharply as many companies withdrew their ads from the platform. Musk changed the name of the company from Twitter to X in July 2023. (Tweets became posts with the change.) Musk had described himself as a “moderate Democrat,” but his views became much more right-wing after his purchase of X. He publicly endorsed Republican presidential candidate on Trump in July 2024. Through his America (PAC), he became the country’s largest political donor, giving $288 million to Trump and other Republican candidates. Explore the individuals tapped for key government roles. Musk spoke at campaign rallies for Trump and through America PAC set up a sweepstakes in which he would pay $1 million a day through to one voter in a key swing state. The action prompted lawsuits alleging that it amounted to paying people to vote, which is illegal. Trump promised during his campaign that Musk and entrepreneur (DOGE, a reference to the cryptocurrency memecoin Dogecoin), charged with making the government more efficient. Musk vowed that in that effort, he would “balance the budget immediately” by cutting $2 trillion in government spending, which would “involve some temporary hardship.” Ramaswamy left DOGE hours after Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025. That same day Trump issued an that set up DOGE inside the United States Digital Service, which was renamed the United States DOGE Service. The order also stated that each federal agency should have a team of at least four DOGE employees. Musk became a “special government employee,” a designation for someone who works for the government on a temporary basis. Many of those involved with DOGE are former or current employees of Musk’s companies. DOGE immediately went to work. On the afternoon of January 20 a DOGE team took over the office of the director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), an agency that manages the federal , and assumed control of key OPM databases. More than two million government employees were emailed a deferred resignation offer. It stated that they would not have to return to their offices if they resigned at the end of September 2025. (The subject line of the email, “Fork in the Road,” was the same as one used in an email Musk sent in 2022, offering resignation to Twitter employees shortly after he took over the service.) DOGE gained access to databases at the Treasury Department’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which disburses most of the government’s payments. Musk announced on X that he and Trump would shut down the . Shortly thereafter USAID’s website was taken down, most of USAID’s 10,000 employees were placed on administrative leave, and programs around the world were suspended. The (NIH) announced that it would cut $4 billion of “indirect costs,” which support hospitals and universities of NIH grant recipients. The Institute of Education Sciences, the research division of the Department of Education, had most of its contracts canceled. DOGE’s actions led to a flurry of lawsuits. Critics of DOGE said that it had precipitated a constitutional crisis, in which the by not spending the money that Congress had appropriated for agencies such as USAID and NIH. However, Republicans, who controlled Congress, claimed there was nothing unusual in a new administration reviewing government spending. This article was most recently revised and updated by\n",

            "Who is Elon Musk and what is his net worth? Natalie Sherman, Dearbail Jordan & Tom Espiner It seems like not a day goes by without billionaire Elon Musk making headlines. The boss of X (formerly Twitter), Tesla and SpaceX is the world's richest person and has used his platform to make his views known on a vast array of topics. He has charged ahead with human brain chip trials at his firm Neuralink, with three patients currently with implants. He's also played with turning X into a super app and tried to cement his presence in the fast-growing world of artificial intelligence And Mr Musk's reach has expanded further still, after Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential election - in which the Tesla executive played a key but controversial role. The president picked the self-proclaimed \"first buddy\" to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (or Doge - a nod to Musk's favourite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin). Musk denied a \"hostile takeover\" as his agency, which is not an official government department, implemented cuts such as dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which distributes tens of billions of dollars' worth of overseas aid every year. Experts have warned of a threat to global health following the move, which could see USAID staff slashed from about 10,000 to fewer than 300 globally And then another twist - Musk pledged to his role at Doge after Tesla reported a 70% drop in profits. His close association with Trump has led to protests and boycotts of Tesla cars globally, with some online using the moniker \"Swasticars\" to refer to them, following Musk's controversial arm gesture at a rally celebrating Trump's return to office. The billionaire twice extended his arm out straight as he thanked the crowd for \"making it happen\". Critics, including some historians, said it was a Nazi salute - but Musk has dismissed that, saying comparisons with Hitler were \"tired\" and \"dirty tricks\". After bursting on to the Silicon Valley scene more than two decades ago, the 53-year-old serial entrepreneur kept the public captivated with his business antics - although his more recent interventions in politics have not been very popular in the UK or Germany. In the UK, Musk accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of being \"deeply complicit\" in grooming gang \"mass rapes in exchange for votes\" - while Sir Keir accused critics of \"spreading lies and misinformation\". In Germany, Musk has endorsed the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), and urged Germans to back the party in forthcoming elections. In the UK and Germany, 71% of people said they took a negative view of Musk, with 63% saying they don't think he has much knowledge of national issues, Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Mr Musk showed his talents for entrepreneurship early, going door-to-door with his brother selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs and developing his first computer game at the age of 12. He has described his childhood as difficult, affected by his parents' divorce, bullying at school and his own difficulty picking up on social cues because of Asperger's Syndrome. At the earliest opportunity, he left home for college, moving to Canada and then the US, where he studied economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League college. In a 2010 essay for Marie Claire , his first wife, Justine Musk, a writer whom he met in college and married in 2000, wrote that even before making his millions Mr Musk was \"not a man who takes no for an answer\". \"The will to compete and dominate, that made him so successful in business, did not magically shut off when he came home,\" she recalled, adding that he told her while dancing at their wedding, \"I am the alpha in this relationship.\" How did Elon Musk make his money? After being accepted to a physics graduate degree programme at Stanford University, Mr Musk quickly dropped out and founded two technology start-ups during the \"dotcom boom\" of the 1990s. These included a web software firm and an online banking company that eventually became PayPal, which was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5bn (£1.2bn). He ploughed his fortune into a new rocket company, SpaceX - which he aimed to make a cost-effective alternative to Nasa - and a new electric car company, Tesla, where he chaired the board until becoming chief executive in 2008. Elon Musk in 2004, soon after starting SpaceX The two firms are credited with upending their industries, even as they sometimes veered close to financial collapse. More recent business ventures include his takeover of social media platform Twitter in October 2022. He dramatically reduced the size of its workforce including, controversially, cuts to teams responsible for keeping the platform safe; rebranded the company as X; and introduced new premium subscriptions so that the business did not rely on advertising alone for income. Mr Musk's long-term ambition is for X to become an \"everything app\" offering a range of services. However, so far the value of the firm has plunged from the $44bn he originally paid to just $9.4bn, according to some estimates. Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\". growing under Mr Musk's X tenure , and some firms don't want to be associated with that. Leaving X can be a tricky decision for brands He also has ambitions in the AI sector, being an early investor in ChatGPT's parent company before parting ways in 2018, and setting up his own company xAI \"to understand the true nature of the universe\" in 2023. sued OpenAI and its boss Sam Altman , saying the firm he helped found had reneged on its non-profit, open source origins by hitching its wagon to Microsoft. A year later, Musk led a takeover bid which was , who suggested a $9.74bn counter-offer for X. \"I'm never hugely convinced that he knows what he wants to do tomorrow,\" says journalist Chris Stokel-Walker of Mr Musk's wide-ranging interests. \"He very much leads by instinct.\" In a 2015 biography, author Ashlee Vance described Mr Musk as \"a confrontational know-it-all\" with an \"abundant ego\". But he also called him an awkward dancer and diffident public speaker. In the press, he's been dubbed both a mad genius and Twitter's biggest troll - known as much for his lofty ambitions as his petty fights, not to mention the more serious lawsuits he and his companies have faced from regulators, investors and others over issues such as racial discrimination and the trustworthiness of his claims. Divorced three times - twice from the same woman, British actress Talulah Riley - Mr Musk is frank about his faults. \"If you list my sins, I sound like the worst person on Earth,\" Mr Musk said in a TED interview in 2022 . \"But if you put those against the things I've done right, it makes much more sense.\" What is Elon Musk's net worth? Those contradictions certainly haven't stopped him amassing a fortune. tracking the wealth of the world's billionaires, Mr Musk is the richest of them all. It estimates his current net worth to be around $379bn, with his fortune soaring alongside Tesla's share price following Trump's election victory. That's based largely on the value of his shares in Tesla, of which he owns more than 13%. The company's stock soared in value - some say unreasonably - in 2020 as the firm's output increased and it started to deliver regular profits. The shares plunged at the end of 2022, with some blaming the distraction of the Twitter takeover for the fall, though they have since recovered a lot of ground. And throughout 2024 Mr Musk was locked in a legal battle over a $56bn pay package from Tesla with a Delaware judge rejecting his claim to it for a second time in December Judge Kathaleen McCormick called the pay-out an \"unfathomable sum\", and argued Mr Musk had influenced the company's board and shareholders - with 75% of them voting to back his pay deal in June Is Elon Musk worth his Tesla pay package? Elon Musk and his son X Æ A-12 in 2021. Mr Musk, who has had 12 children, has called \"population collapse\" a bigger risk than global warming Mr Musk also champions digital currencies and has a hand in several other smaller companies, including tunnel-maker the Boring Company. Mr Musk, who wears the mantle of a workaholic proudly, has often said he's not in business simply to make money - claims he repeated recently with regard to his Twitter takeover. \"Elon only gets involved with things if he feels that they're critically important for some reason... for the sake of society or humanity,\" says friend and Tesla investor Ross Gerber. Why does Elon Musk support Trump? For a long time Mr Musk, who became a US citizen in 2002, resisted efforts to label his politics - calling himself \"half-Democrat, half-Republican\", \"politically moderate\" and \"independent\". He says he voted for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and - reluctantly - Joe Biden, all of them Democrats. But in recent years he's swung behind Donald Trump, who is a Republican. told media company the Daily Wire his transgender daughter was \"killed\" by transitioning, and that he \"vowed to destroy the woke mind virus\". He is now estranged from his daughter. Musk officially endorsed Trump for a second term in 2024 and became one of the campaign's foremost backers and influencers. He became critical of the Democrat party's stance on a number of issues, including the economy, immigration and gun control - decrying many of its policies as \"woke\". Mr Musk also repeatedly claimed that freedom of speech, enshrined in the first amendment of the US Constitution, would be under threat with another Democrat government. He appeared at several Republican rallies in the run-up to the election, raised millions to fund a political action committee to help re-elect Trump, and frequently voiced his support for Trump in posts on X. Mr Musk's America Super PAC also ran a $1m giveaway to voters in battleground states in the last weeks of the campaign. Why tech bros are backing Trump It was far from his first political controversy. He has shared controversial takes on X about issues facing countries worldwide, such as suggesting the UK was on the cusp of \"civil war\" amid violent unrest in August While Mr Musk provided his Starlink satellite internet service to Ukraine, he also attracted criticism for refusing an emergency request from Kyiv to activate Starlink in Sevastopol, home to a major Russian navy port In the US, he moved to Texas, complaining of California's regulations and high taxes; has clashed with union organisers; and, in the spring of 2020, decried coronavirus lockdowns as \"fascist\". Elon Musk at the opening party for the Tesla gigafactory in Austin, Texas In the past he has said that he sees his businesses as a form of philanthropy, because they are focused on solving major human issues, such as climate change in the case of Tesla. However, he has since moderated his views on climate change, it is \"real, just much slower than alarmists claim\". Despite his own interest in artificial intelligence, he has also been one of the most prominent figures expressing concern about the supposed threat to humanity's future that super-intelligent AIs might pose. He has claimed that the rise of artificial intelligence, combined with a declining birth rate, could result in \"not enough people\" being in the world. Mr Musk has had 12 children - six with his first wife, three with Canadian singer Grimes, and three with Shivon Zilis.

            "The Decline and Fall of Elon Musk The Tesla innovator becomes the latest government employee to lose his job. Yuri Gripas / The Washington Post / Getty using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Updated at 6:50 p.m. ET on May 21, 2025. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was shouting at Elon Musk in the halls of the West Wing last month, loud enough for Donald Trump to hear and in a language that he could certainly understand. Bessent and Musk were fighting over which of them should choose the next IRS leader—and, implicitly, over Musk’s bureaucracy-be-damned crusade. Without securing the Treasury chief’s sign-off, Musk had pushed through his own pick for the job. Bessent was, quite obviously, not having it. The fight had started outside the Oval Office; it continued past the Roosevelt Room and toward the chief of staff’s office, and then barreled around the corner to the national security adviser’s warren. Musk accused Bessent of having run two failed hedge funds. “I can’t hear you,” he told Bessent as they argued, their faces just inches apart. “Say it louder.” Musk came to Washington all Cybertrucks and chain saws, ready to destroy the bureaucracy, fire do-nothing federal workers, and, he bragged, save taxpayers $2 trillion in the process. He was a –T-shirt-wearing disruptor who promised to rewire how the government operates and to defeat the “woke mind virus,” all under the auspices of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency. For weeks, he and his merry band of DOGE bros gleefully jumped from agency to agency, terrorizing bureaucrats, demanding access to sensitive data, and leaving . But as Musk winds down his official time in Washington, he has found himself isolated within the upper reaches of the Trump administration, having failed to build necessary alliances and irritating many of the department and agency heads he was ostensibly there to help. His team failed to find anything close to the 13-figure savings he’d promised. Court challenges clipped other projects. Cabinet secretaries blocked DOGE cuts they said reduced crucial services. All the while, Musk’s net worth fell, his companies tanked in value, and he became an object of frequent gossip and ridicule. Four months after Musk’s swashbuckling arrival, he is effectively moving on, shifting his attention back to his jobs as the leader of Tesla, SpaceX, and X, among his other companies. In a call last month with Wall Street analysts, Musk said he was planning to spend “a day or two per week” focusing on DOGE issues—similar to how he manages each of his various companies. The next week, he seemed to suggest that he’d be slimming down his government portfolio even more, telling reporters that he expected to be in Washington “every other week.” Yesterday, he told the Qatar Economic Forum in that he no longer sees a reason to spend money on politics, though that could change in the future. “I think I’ve done enough,” he said. Listen: Elon Musk’s luck runs out He remains close with Trump, who still shows genuine affection for his billionaire benefactor, according to advisers and allies. But Musk’s decision to focus elsewhere has been greeted as a relief by many federal leaders, who have been busily undoing many of his cuts in their departments or making DOGE-style changes on their own terms. Cabinet leaders—who did not appreciate being treated like staff by the man boasting about feeding their fiefdom into a “wood chipper”—have widely ignored some of his efforts, such as his February that all federal employees send weekly emails to their supervisors laying out their accomplishments in bullet points. “How many people were fired because they didn’t send in their three things a week or whatever the fuck it was?” one Trump adviser, who requested anonymity to speak frankly, told us. “I think that everyone is ready to move on from this part of the administration.” was immediate fodder—for gossip, of course, but also for a kind of Rorschach test for MAGA-world loyalties. Several members of the administration heard it themselves. Many, many more learned about it secondhand, or even thirdhand. (Some of the details were first reported by A mild-mannered billionaire stood up to “a man-child”! Musk rugby-shouldered Bessent! There was definitely nothing physical! There was caterwauling! Musk should have been arrested! Musk did nothing wrong! It wasn’t even a big deal! After the shouting ended, Musk’s pick for IRS commissioner found himself replaced with Bessent’s more seasoned choice after just three days on the job. Bessent had won. The power struggle has become a symbol of Musk’s inability to build support for his approach. This story is based on interviews with 14 White House advisers, outside allies, and confidants, who all requested anonymity to describe private conversations. The White House and the Treasury Department declined to comment on the specifics of the fight, and a representative for Musk did not respond to requests for comment. A couple of weeks after his argument with Bessent, Musk gathered reporters in the Roosevelt Room to defend himself, admitting that his latest goal of $1 trillion in taxpayer spending—already down from his initial $2 trillion target—had proved “really, really difficult.” “We are making as much progress as we can—there’s a lot of inertia in the government,” he told the . “So it’s, like, it’s not easy. This is—this is a way to make a lot of enemies and not that many friends.” At the core of Musk’s challenges was his unfamiliarity with reforming an organization that, unlike his own companies, he does not fully control. Rather than taking the time to navigate and understand the quirks and nuances of the federal government—yes, an often lumbering and inefficient institution—Musk instead told his team to move fast: It would be better to backtrack later, if necessary, than to proceed with caution. (One administration official told us that Musk’s view was that if he hadn’t fired so many people that he needed to rehire some, it would mean that he hadn’t cut enough.) As he sought to solve spending and digital-infrastructure problems, he often created new issues for Trump, the president’s top advisers, and Capitol Hill allies. “He came with a playbook that comes from outside government, and there were mixed returns on that,” Matt Calkins, the CEO of Appian, a Virginia-based software company that automates business processes and has worked with the federal government for more than two decades, told us. “He comes in with his idealism and his Silicon Valley playbook, and a few interesting things happened. Does the ‘move fast and break things’ model work in Washington? Not really.” Calkins told us that he very much supports Musk’s stated goals: government efficiency and modernization, and harnessing technology to improve the lives of citizens. But, he explained, Washington will never work the way Silicon Valley does. Its capacity for disruption is lower; although people may enjoy summoning Uber rides or ordering food via their phone, they do not rely on these innovations the way many do on, say, public education or Medicaid. “Government is a foundation, versus a technology company that usually provides a bonus—something we enjoy consuming, but not something we count on,” Calkins said. Musk’s operation claims to have found $170 billion in savings by cutting grants, contracts, leases, and other spending, though the numbers have frequently been revised down owing to errors and program reinstatements. The federal workforce—roughly , including military personnel—is slated to be reduced by tens of thousands, though many of those cuts are now in limbo because of recent court orders. White House aides privately admit that a high-profile claim of fraud that Musk uncovered—that some people in Social Security databases are listed as unrealistically old—is a data problem but not evidence of actual fraud: The government had already blocked payments to those people before Musk pointed them out. (Nevertheless, Trump repeated the claim in his first official address to Congress, in March, and Musk caused a mini political crisis for the administration when he appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast and declared Social Security—an entitlement that Trump has promised not to touch—“the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.”) Most important, Trump has made clear that Musk did not have the freedom to reshape the government as he would one of his companies. Weeks after Musk appeared onstage with a chain saw to illustrate his plans for the federal government, Trump rebuked the approach on social media: “We say the ‘scalpel’ rather than the ‘hatchet,’” Trump wrote. Musk’s legal opponents have taken to celebrating his departure as a defeat for his larger ambitions. They point to public polling that shows that has fallen markedly since the start of the year, as well as to the backlash he faced when he went to Wisconsin to campaign for a Republican-backed state-supreme-court candidate who ended up losing by double digits. “We kicked him out of town,” Rushab Sanghvi, the general counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, told us. “If he had stayed in the shadows and done his stuff, who knows how bad it would have been? But no one likes the guy.” at the end of April, possibly Musk’s last, the Tesla and SpaceX leader reduced himself to a punch line, wearing two caps—a red one perched atop his signature black hat. He joked about all the jobs that he was juggling. “As they say, I wear a lot of hats. And as you can see, it’s true. Even my hat has a hat,” he said, prompting genuine laughter. The uprising against Musk—in hindsight, the abrupt beginning of the slow end—had begun in the same room a month earlier, at an impromptu meeting. Cabinet secretaries, who had not yet been confirmed for office when Musk began his work, had been expressing frustration to Trump and to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, among others, about Musk’s meddling. Musk, meanwhile, had been griping about what he viewed as the slow pace of hiring. In fact, the Trump administration had been staffing up remarkably quickly by federal standards for a new administration. But, as one White House adviser explained to us, “if you’re Elon, in the business of firing people, it’s easy to see hiring through a different lens.” Sick of presiding over the competing complaints, Trump finally declared: Bring them all in here, and we’ll have at it. The next day, the Cabinet secretaries did just that. Details of the meeting—including Musk’s heated back-and-forth with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, as well as with Doug Collins, the secretary of veterans affairs, and Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary—almost immediately leaked into . Musk upbraided Rubio during the meeting for not sufficiently reducing his staff, and Rubio—already upset that Musk had essentially dissolved USAID, one of the agencies under his purview—vigorously fought back. (“That was one of the turning points for Trump and Marco, where Trump realized Marco had a little spine,” one Trump ally told us.) Several people told us that though Musk understood that he was walking into an ambush, he was unaware of the extent of the coming pile-on. After the “whining about DOGE” and Musk generally “taking it,” someone familiar with the meeting told us, Musk defended his efforts. At one point, he declared that his real problem was not with firing people or reducing the size of government but with quickly hiring new, better people. (Early on, Musk had been irritated that he couldn’t instantaneously hire DOGE engineers, who found themselves subjected to the same MAGA loyalty tests as everyone else, and he was unable to muscle onto the government payroll a Turkish-born venture capitalist with a green card, because U.S. law generally prohibits noncitizens from working for the federal government.) Sergio Gor, the director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, defended the pace of hiring, which he oversees. The relationship between Musk and Gor had already been tense, several advisers told us; one adviser explained that the two men were “constantly sniping at each other.” Sometime after the Cabinet meeting, Musk went to the president and, referring to Gor, said, “Please tell me I never have to ask him for anything again,” the adviser told us. With Musk’s DOGE team largely in place, he and Gor have had less reason in recent weeks to interact. Others told us that the two men have since buried any disagreements and get along fine. But the clash was yet another example of Musk chafing against the strictures of government processes, something Gor’s office is designed to uphold. “There’s not a lot of reverence for the system with Elon,” the Trump adviser told us. “It’s not a perfect system, but it is nonetheless our system.” Musk’s influence on the early months of the Trump administration is, of course, undeniable. He regularly amplified administration messaging—and occasionally undercut it—on X, the social-media platform he owns. And he focused attention on an issue that many voters agree should be a priority, at least in theory: eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in Washington, and making the government more efficient and technologically nimble. He also cut large swaths of the federal workforce, albeit in such a “haphazard” way, as one adviser put it to us, that the actual results have proved mixed. Some talented and experienced career bureaucrats—the sorts of officials Trump and Musk ostensibly wanted to retain—decamped to the private sector or took early retirement, and the general chaos led to some fired employees being hired back. At the Federal Aviation Administration, Musk’s interference and cuts have , especially among already overtaxed air-traffic controllers. Musk also made himself the public face of the Trump administration’s decision to shut down USAID, a decision that the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates described as “the world’s richest man killing the world’s poorest children.” (Musk, who’d initially earned the fraught designation of “co-president” and seemed destined for a rocket-fuel-caliber blowup with the actual president, also lasted much longer in government than many had surmised he would—and is exiting with something akin to grace, at least by Trumpian standards.) Ayushi Roy, a former technologist at the General Services Administration who now teaches digital government at Harvard Kennedy School, told us that Musk has achieved at least some of his goals: cutting the federal workforce and traumatizing the employees who remain. But, she said, he has largely failed to build anything that’s made government more efficient. “I am waiting for them to actually deliver something. Right now they have just been deleting things. They haven’t added any value,” she told us. “If it is just us hatcheting things instead of improving or even replacing them, the goal, to me, is not actually about improving efficiency.” Calkins, the software CEO, cautioned us to not undersell what Musk has done. Given the “resolute structure” of government bureaucracy, he said, it’s impressive that Musk even “got a few big nicks.” In Calkins’s view, Musk might have been more successful had he been given more time—maybe a year and a half, he estimated. He told us that he thinks more cuts to government are necessary, but that Musk’s approach was insufficiently judicious. “In retrospect,” Calkins concluded, “it wasn’t nearly as much as we needed, and we probably didn’t need the chain saw. We needed the chisel.” to life outside his companies, where his whims reigned supreme and he rarely needed to build consensus. “He miscalculated his ability to act just completely autonomously,” one outside Trump adviser told us. “He had some missteps in all of these agencies, which would have been fine because everyone acknowledges that when you’re moving fast and breaking things, not everything is going to go right. But it’s different when you do that and you don’t even have the buy-in of the agency you’re setting on fire.” Musk also found himself clashing with other Trump advisers on policy questions that could take a bite out of his personal fortune. The billionaire argued against the administration’s tariff bonanza—at one point, he urged “a zero-tariff situation” between the United States and Europe—and publicly attacked Trump’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, calling him “dumber than a sack of bricks.” In late March, according to , Musk was preparing to receive a secret briefing from the Pentagon on the country’s planning for a potential war with China. After the story published, Trump posted on social media that Musk’s trip to the Pentagon would not include any China briefing. But the report prompted a public outcry, including over Musk’s many potential conflicts of interest. Read: The actual math behind DOGE’s cuts “You could feel it, everything changed, the fever had been broken,” the longtime Trump ally and Musk foe Steve Bannon told us in a text message about the Pentagon uproar. In Bannon’s view, government officials had opted to leak to the rather than directly confront Musk or bring their concerns to the president—a troubling sign, he told us, of Musk’s outsize power. Now Trump-administration officials wonder just what will happen to DOGE once Musk pivots elsewhere. In some cases, DOGE employees have already become more formally enmeshed in the administration, taking on official roles within government agencies. A top Musk aide is now the Interior Department’s assistant secretary of policy management and budget, and a DOGE point person to the Department of Energy is now chief of staff. One administration official told us that Musk’s much-vaunted—and initially chaotic—reductions in the federal workforce are now coming to fruition across the government, but in a more organized fashion. Musk’s “special government employee” status always meant that he was going to depart the government after 130 days. But for a time, there was West Wing chatter about stretching the limit of a “working day” to allow him to extend his time in the administration. Now even Musk has stopped stoking those expectations. “The mission of DOGE—to cut waste, fraud, and abuse—will surely continue,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told us in an email. “DOGE employees who onboarded at their respective agencies will continue to work with President Trump’s cabinet to make our government more efficient.” Speaking to a group of reporters earlier this month, Musk implied that DOGE is self-sustaining and could carry on without him. “DOGE is a way of life,” he told them, “like Buddhism.” But when asked how, exactly, DOGE could continue, he was coy. “Is Buddha needed for Buddhism?” he asked.

            "is one of the most prolific modern inventors, responsible for groundbreaking advancements in futuristic technologies such as renewable energy and space travel. Many of his innovations, which once seemed straight out of a science fiction movie, have led to significant scientific breakthroughs. After earning his first fortune from the internet payment service PayPal, Musk invested $100 million in his space exploration company, SpaceX, which develops satellites, launch vehicles, and other spacecraft for both NASA and private ventures. SpaceX has achieved remarkable milestones, including the first privately funded spacecraft to reach the International Space Station. Musk’s revolutionary ideas often focus on space travel, renewable energy, and commercial electric vehicles, anticipating a future where fossil fuels and other natural resources are scarce. His efforts have led to the creation of Tesla, Inc., a leader in the electric car industry, and SolarCity, which promotes renewable energy solutions. These visionary endeavors have earned him recognition and numerous awards in both scientific and philanthropic circles. In popular culture, Musk is often portrayed as a real-life superhero, committed to solving global challenges through innovative technologies. He also envisions a future with intelligent life beyond Earth and has set ambitious goals, such as establishing a human colony on Mars. His groundbreaking work continues to shape the future, making him a truly illustrious figure.

What is Elon Musk's role at Tesla? What is Neuralink and what is Elon Musk's involvement with it? What is the Hyperloop and how is Elon Musk associated with it? What are some notable achievements of SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk? Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. The oldest of three siblings with a prodigious family name, he grew up in the last decades of Apartheid. His parents were Maye Musk, a British-Canadian model and Errol Musk, a South Africa born British electrical engineer. When they divorced in 1980, Elon stayed mainly with his father in South Africa. A few years later, he began teaching himself computer programming and sold his first video game at the age of 12. For his undergraduate education he attended the Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, in 1990. He eventually transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, earning dual degree in Physics and Economics. In addition to the bachelor’s degrees, he earned in physics and economics, he also holds an honorary doctorate in Design from the ‘Art Center College of Design’ and an honorary doctorate in Aerospace Engineering from the ‘University of Surrey’. He moved to California to attend Stanford for a PhD in applied physics in 1995, but quit within a few of days to pursue his own interests in avenues of technology and entrepreneurship. Later that year, he worked with his brother, Kimbal Musk, to develop the software company ‘Zip2’, which provided services to high end newspaper clients like 'The New York Times' and the 'Chicago Tribune'. After the successful sale of Zip2 to Compaq in 1999, Musk went straight into his next venture, an online financial service called ‘X.com’. Shortly after the company acquired a money transfer service called ‘PayPal’, through a merger, they began to focus their efforts exclusively on building this internet payment service. The success of ‘PayPal’ led Musk to sell his stock in the company to ‘eBay’ for $165 million. In 2002, he invested his millions in his third company ‘Space Exploration Technologies’ or just ‘SpaceX’. Within seven years, the company had designed the ‘Falcon’ line of space launch vehicles and the ‘Dragon’ line of multi-purpose spacecraft and was making history with their privately funded innovation. ‘SpaceX’ received contracts from NASA to create a launch craft to deliver cargo to the ‘International Space Station’. Tesla Motors was founded with the mission of designing and building electric cars. Musk invested in the company and became its chairman in 2004, a year after its inception, taking on an active role in the design of the ‘Roadster’, which won the ‘Global Green’ product award. During the recession when the company was adversely affected, he went on to become the CEO and product architect of the company, a role he holds till today. After designing the initial concept for ‘SolarCity’, Musk remains its biggest shareholder. Today, it is the second largest provider of solar energy in the United States, with a focus on combating global warming. On August 12, 2013, Musk announced revolutionary plans for a high speed travel technology that, in theory, could replace airplane travel as a faster and cheaper option. His company ‘SpaceX’ is currently working on putting his plans into practice, with the design intended to run entirely on solar energy. He has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop. It incorporates reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on air bearings driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. In July 2017, he announced that first successful test run of Hyperloop has been done in Nevada. He also said that he has got verbal approval to build a hyperloop from New York City to Washington D.C. In September 2018,  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Musk for a tweet in which he claimed that funding had been secured for taking Tesla. Musk reached a  private. The lawsuit sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO on publicly traded companies. Later on Musk reached a settlement with the SEC. Under it terms, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each and Musk had to step down as Tesla chairman while remaining Tesla's CEO. In place of Musk,  Robyn Denholm was named as Tesla's acting Chairman SpaceX has completed several contracts for NASA, sending its Falcon 9 spacecraft to the International Space Station with cargo. This spacecraft replaced the space shuttle when it retired in 2011. Musk was heavily involved in the design of Tesla Motors' first electric sports car, the ‘Tesla Roadster’. Musk received the 2006 ‘Global Green’ product design award for this vehicle, presented by Mikhail Gorbachev. In 2010, the premier world organization for aerospace records, the ‘Fédération Aéronautique Internationale’ awarded Musk the ‘FAI Gold Space Medal. He shares this highest honor with prominent personalities like Neil Armstrong and John Glenn.

He was ranked 21st wealthiest person in America in the 2017 Forbes 400 list. Elon Musk has married thrice and twice to the same woman. His first marriage was to Canadian author Justine Wilson in 2000. They had six children together: all sons. Their first son, Nevada Alexander Musk, died at the age of 10 weeks. The couple had five more sons through IVF; twins in 2004, followed by triplets in 2006. Elon Musk and Justine Wilson divorced in 2008. In 2008, he began dating English actress, Talulah Riley, and the two of them got married in 2010. The couple separated in 2012. In 2013, Elon Musk remarried Talulah Riley but the couple filed for divorce in 2014 and it was finalised in 2016. Elon Musk was briefly in a relationship with American actress in 2016, but the couple split owing to their conflicting schedules. Elon Musk started dating Canadian musician in 2018. In May 2020, Grimes gave birth to their son. In March 2021, Musk stated that he was single. In March 2022, Grimes revealed that they have broken up and she further stated that they welcomed a daughter through surrogacy in December 2021. In 2022, Insider, an American financial and business news website, published court documents stating that Elon Musk had fathered twins with Shivon Zilis, a top executive at one of his companies, in November 2021. As of January 2025, Elon Musk is known to have fathered at least 12 children. Elon Musk's sister, Tosca Musk, is the founder of Musk Entertainment and has produced several movies. Elon Musk was the inspiration for the character of Tony Stark in the \"Iron Man\" movies, as the filmmakers saw similarities between Musk's innovative spirit and Stark's genius inventor persona. Musk once launched a Tesla Roadster into space aboard his company SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, with the car now orbiting the sun as part of a demonstration mission.

For other uses, see \"300-metre tower\" and \"Tour Eiffel\" redirect here. For other tall towers, see Tallest in the world from 1889 to 1930 Société d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel . Archived from the original on 22 April 2016. , France. It is named after the engineer , whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889. \" (French for \"Iron Lady\"), it was constructed as the centrepiece of the , and to crown the centennial anniversary of the . Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world. The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022. The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world: 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was designated a in 1964, and was named part of a (\"Paris, Banks of the Seine\") in 1991. The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the . Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200 meters and 300 meters mark in height. Due to the addition of a broadcasting at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground—the highest public . Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second, making the entire ascent a 600-step climb. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift. On this top, third level, is a private apartment built for Gustave Eiffel, who decorated it with furniture made by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such as The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to , two senior engineers working for the . It was envisaged after discussion about a suitable centrepiece for the proposed to celebrate the centennial of the . In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked , the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments. First drawing of the Eiffel Tower by Maurice Koechlin including size comparison with other Parisian landmarks such as ; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise [n]ot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude. Little progress was made until 1886, when was re-elected as president of France and was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars. (A 300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.) On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details. After some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. Eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, the contract granting him 1.5 million toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself. (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel Tower. During the period of the tower's construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from , some of which went towards the financing of the tower. These loans were connected to that saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the , and required Haiti to pay the CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, \"effectively choking off the nation's primary source of income\". According to , \"[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country.\" Caricature of Gustave Eiffel comparing the Eiffel tower to the The proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter, and many people believed it was impossible. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as . A petition called \"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, , and it was published by We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection ... of this useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower ... To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream. And for twenty years ... we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal. Salut monde dont je suis la langue éloquente que sa bouche Ô Paris tire et tirera toujours aux allemands (\"Hello world, of which I am the eloquent tongue which your mouth, O Paris, will forever stick out at the Germans\"). Gustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the : \"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man. Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\" These criticisms were also dealt with by Édouard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, sardonically saying, \"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way. Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection. Eiffel pointed out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\" Some of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built; others remained unconvinced. supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible. By 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a ) to express his feelings about the war against Germany. Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of , and is often featured in films and literature. of the Eiffel Tower, photographed in 1887 Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887. Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river , were more complicated: each slab needed two 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft) to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork. Each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.5 m (25 ft) long. The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed. The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 1 mm (0.04 in) and angles worked out to one The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038 pieces were joined using 2.5 million rivets. At first, the legs were constructed as , but about halfway to the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber . This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \"Eiffel Suicide!\" and \"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\" appeared in the tabloid press. Multiple famous artists of that time, , thought poorly of the newly made tower. Charles Garnier thought it was a \"truly tragic street lamp\". Alexandre Dumas said that it was like \"Odius shadow of the odious column built of rivets and iron plates extending like a black blot\". There were multiple protests over the style and the reasoning of placing it in the middle of Paris. At this stage, a small \"creeper\" designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888. Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments to precisely align the legs; were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by on the scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees, due to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens, only one person died. The start of the erection of the metalwork Construction of the legs with scaffolding Start of construction on the second stage View of the 1889 World's Fair The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower. Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, Émile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from , completed the ascent. At 2:35 pm, Eiffel hoisted a large to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level. There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May. Tickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays, and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors. After dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light. Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition. The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top. Illumination of the tower at night during the exposition; painted by On the second level, the French newspaper had an office and a printing press, where a special souvenir edition, At the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit. were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower. Gustave Eiffel described the collection of responses as \"truly curious\". (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his , a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition. with this message on September 10, 1889: To M Eiffel the Engineer the brave builder of so gigantic and original specimen of modern Engineering from one who has the greatest respect and admiration for all Engineers including the Great Engineer the Bon Dieu, Thomas Edison. Eiffel made use of his apartment at the top of the tower to carry out , and also used the tower to perform experiments on the action of air resistance on falling bodies. Panoramic view during ascent of the Eiffel Tower by the Eiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years. It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the . The city had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for many innovations in the early 20th century, particularly , it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit, and from 1910 it also became part of the International Time Service. , the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille. These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism as the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower. Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism. At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later. Santos-Dumont No. 5; 13 July 1901 , won a 100,000-franc prize offered by for the first person to make a flight from to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than half an hour. sent the time to sea daily through the Eiffel Tower within a radius of 5 000 km. On 9 March 1911, France adopted by law. However, the law did not refer to In 1912, following a report by organized at the Paris Observatory a was created and installed in the premises of the Paris Observatory. However, due to , the International Convention was never ratified. In 1919, the existence of the International Time Bureau was formalized under the authority of an International Time Commission, under the aegis of the at the top and bottom of the tower. He found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as Two years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor died after jumping from the first level of the tower (a height of 57 m) to demonstrate his In 1914, at the outbreak of , a radio transmitter located in the tower German radio communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and contributing to the Allied victory at the , the Eiffel Tower's wireless station played a crucial role in intercepting enemy communications from Berlin. In 1914, French forces successfully launched a counter-attack during the Battle of the Marne after gaining critical intelligence on the German Army's movements. In 1917, the station intercepted a coded message between Germany and Spain that referenced 'Operative H-21.' This information contributed to the arrest, conviction, and execution of , the famous spy accused of working for Germany. From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for adorned three of the tower's sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world at the time. In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental low-resolution television transmissions, using a transmitter of 200 watts power. On 17 November, an improved 180-line transmitter was installed. The Eiffel Tower has been a subject of art, as in Champs de Mars: The Red Tower On two separate but related occasions in 1925, the con artist \"sold\" the tower for scrap metal. A year later, in February 1926, pilot Leon Collet was killed trying to fly under the tower. His aircraft became entangled in an aerial belonging to a wireless station. was unveiled at the base of the north leg on 2 May 1929. In 1930, the tower lost the title of the in New York City was completed. In 1938, the decorative arcade around the first level was removed. of Paris in 1940, the lift cables were by the French. The tower was  restricted to German visitors during the occupation and the lifts were not repaired until 1946. In 1940, German soldiers had to climb the tower to hoist a swastika-centred but the flag was so large it blew away just a few hours later, and was replaced by a smaller one. When visiting Paris, Hitler chose to stay on the ground. When the were nearing Paris in August 1944, Hitler ordered General , the military governor of Paris, to demolish the tower along with the rest of the city. Von Choltitz disobeyed the order. On 25 August, before the Germans had been , the German flag was replaced with a Tricolour by two men from the , who narrowly beat three men led by Lucien Sarniguet, who had lowered the Tricolour on 13 June 1940 when Paris fell to the Germans. A fire started in the television transmitter on 3 January 1956, damaging the top of the tower. Repairs took a year, and in 1957, the present radio aerial was added to the top. In 1964, the Eiffel Tower was officially declared to be a historical monument by the Minister of Cultural Affairs, A year later, an additional lift system was installed in the north pillar. for the tower to be dismantled and temporarily relocated to Montreal to serve as a landmark and tourist attraction during . The plan was allegedly vetoed by the company operating the tower out of fear that the French government could refuse permission for the tower to be restored in its original location. In 1982, the original lifts between the second and third levels were replaced after 97 years in service. These had been closed to the public between November and March because the water in the hydraulic drive tended to freeze. The new cars operate in pairs, with one counterbalancing the other, and perform the journey in one stage, reducing the journey time from eight minutes to less than two minutes. At the same time, two new emergency staircases were installed, replacing the original spiral staircases. In 1983, the south pillar was fitted with an electrically driven Otis lift to serve the The Fives-Lille lifts in the east and west legs, fitted in 1899, were extensively refurbished in 1986. The cars were replaced, and a computer system was installed to completely automate the lifts. The was moved from the water hydraulic system to a new electrically driven oil-filled hydraulic system, and the original water hydraulics were retained solely as a counterbalance system. A service lift was added to the south pillar for moving small loads and maintenance personnel three years later. under the tower on 31 March 1984. from the top of the Eiffel Tower, using a special cord he had helped develop. Hackett was arrested by the police. On 27 October 1991, Thierry Devaux, along with mountain guide Hervé Calvayrac, performed a series of acrobatic figures while bungee jumping from the second floor of the tower. Facing the Champ de Mars, Devaux used an electric winch between figures to go back up to the second floor. When firemen arrived, he stopped after the sixth jump. The tower is a focal point for New Year's Eve and For its \"Countdown to the Year 2000\" celebration on 31 December 1999, flashing lights and high-powered were installed on the tower. During the last three minutes of the year, the lights were turned on starting from the base of the tower and continuing to the top to welcome 2000 with a huge fireworks show. An exhibition above a cafeteria on the first floor commemorates this event. The searchlights on top of the tower made it a beacon in Paris's night sky, and 20,000 flashing bulbs gave the tower a sparkly appearance for five minutes every hour on the hour. The lights sparkled blue for several nights to herald the new millennium on 31 December 2000. The sparkly lighting continued for 18 months until July 2001. The sparkling lights were turned on again on 21 June 2003, and the display was planned to last for 10 years before they needed replacing. The tower has operated at its maximum capacity of about 7 million visitors per year since 2003. In 2004, the Eiffel Tower began hosting a seasonal ice rink on the first level. was installed on the first level during the 2014 refurbishment. (wrought iron) of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 and the addition of lifts, shops and antennae have brought the total weight to approximately 10,100 tonnes. As a demonstration of the economy of design, if the 7,300 tonnes of metal in the structure were melted down, it would fill the square base, 125 metres (410 ft) on each side, to a depth of only 6.25 cm (2.46 in) assuming the density of the metal to be 7.8 tonnes per cubic metre. Additionally, a cubic box surrounding the tower (324 m × 125 m × 125 m) would contain 6,200 tonnes of air, weighing almost as much as the iron itself. Depending on the , the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to 18 cm (7 in) due to of the metal on the side facing the sun. Lightning striking the Eiffel Tower in 1902 When it was built, Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering. However, Eiffel and his team were experienced bridge builders. In an interview with the newspaper published on 14 February 1887, Eiffel said: Is it not true that the very conditions which give strength also conform to the hidden rules of harmony? ... Now to what phenomenon did I have to give primary concern in designing the Tower? It was wind resistance. Well then! I hold that the curvature of the monument's four outer edges, which is as mathematical calculation dictated it should be ... will give a great impression of strength and beauty, for it will reveal to the eyes of the observer the boldness of the design as a whole. He used graphical methods to determine the strength of the tower and to account for the effects of wind, rather than a mathematical formula. Close examination of the tower reveals a basically All parts of the tower were overdesigned to ensure maximum resistance to wind forces. The top half was assumed to have no gaps in the latticework. After it was completed, some have put forward various mathematical hypotheses in an attempt to explain the success of the design. A one devised in 2004 after letters sent by Eiffel to the French Society of Civil Engineers in 1885 were translated into English described it as a non-linear integral equation based on counteracting the wind pressure on any point of the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point. The Eiffel Tower sways by up to 9 cm (3.5 in) in the wind. The four columns of the tower each house access stairs and lifts to the first two floors, while at the south column only the lift to the second floor restaurant is publicly accessible. The first floor is publicly accessible by lift or stairs. When originally built, the first level contained three restaurants—one French, one Russian and one —and an \"Anglo-American Bar\". After the exposition closed, the Flemish restaurant was converted to a 250-seat theatre. Today there is the A promenade 2.6-metre (8 ft 6 in) wide ran around the outside of the first level The second floor is publicly accessible by lift or stairs and has a restaurant called restaurant with its own lift going up from the south column to the second level. This restaurant has one star in the . It was run by the multi- As of May 2019, it is managed by three-star chef It owes its name to the famous science-fiction writer The third floor is the top floor, publicly accessible by lift. Originally there were laboratories for various experiments, and a small apartment reserved for Gustave Eiffel to entertain guests, which is now open to the public, complete with period decorations and lifelike of Eiffel and some of his notable guests. Gustave Eiffel's apartment at the third floor From 1937 until 1981, there was a restaurant near the top of the tower. It was removed due to structural considerations; engineers had determined it was too heavy and was causing the tower to sag. This restaurant was sold to an American restaurateur and transported to New York and then New Orleans. It was rebuilt on the edge of as a restaurant and later event hall. Today there is a champagne bar. The arrangement of the lifts has been changed several times during the tower's history. Given the elasticity of the cables and the time taken to align the cars with the landings, each lift, in normal service, takes an average of 8 minutes and 50 seconds to do the round trip, spending an average of 1 minute and 15 seconds at each level. The average journey time between levels is 1 minute. The original hydraulic mechanism is on public display in a small museum at the base of the east and west legs. Because the mechanism requires frequent lubrication and maintenance, public access is often restricted. The rope mechanism of the north tower can be seen as visitors exit the lift. The Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape lifts during construction Equipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level, or even the second, lifts had to be the main means of ascent. Constructing lifts to reach the first level was done by making the legs wide enough at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track. A contract was given to the French company Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape for two lifts to be fitted in the east and west legs. Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape used a pair of endless chains with rigid, articulated links to which the car was attached. Lead weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most of the car's weight. The car was pushed up from below, not pulled up from above: to prevent the chain buckling, it was enclosed in a conduit. At the bottom of the run, the chains passed around 3.9 m (12 ft 10 in) diameter . Smaller sprockets at the top guided the chains. The Otis lifts originally fitted in the north and south legs. Installing lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of submitted a proposal, but this was rejected: the fair's charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for bids was extended, but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract was given to Otis in July 1887. Otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs. The car was divided into two superimposed compartments, each holding 25 passengers, with the lift operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level. was provided by an inclined hydraulic ram 12.67 m (41 ft 7 in) long and 96.5 cm (38.0 in) in diameter in the tower leg with a stroke of 10.83 m (35 ft 6 in): this moved a carriage carrying six sheaves. Five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg, producing an arrangement similar to a but acting in reverse, multiplying the stroke of the piston rather than the force generated. The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level. After being exhausted from the cylinder, the water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room at the base of the south leg. This reservoir also provided power to the lifts to the first level. The original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by Léon Edoux. A pair of 81 m (266 ft) hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car travelled only half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway. The 10-ton cars each held 65 passengers. List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower Gustave Eiffel engraved on the building of the tower the names of 72 French scientists, engineers and mathematicians as a recognition of their contributions. Eiffel chose this \"invocation of science\" because of his concern over the artists' protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the engravings were painted over, but they were restored in 1986–87 by the Société Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel , a company operating the tower. The tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to complement the Parisian sky. It was originally reddish brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as \"Eiffel Tower Brown\". In what is expected to be a temporary change, the tower was painted Following the 2024 Summer Olympics held in Paris, Mayor on the tower permanently. The rings, which measure 95 feet (29 m) wide and 43 feet (13 m) high, were initially installed for the Games and were scheduled for removal after the . Hidalgo's decision faced criticism from the Eiffel family and some residents concerned about altering the protected monument. The original 30-ton rings would be replaced with lighter versions for long-term display. The only non-structural elements are the four decorative grill-work arches, added in Sauvestre's sketches, which served to make the tower look more substantial and to make a more impressive entrance to the exposition. A pop-culture movie cliché is that the view from a Parisian window always includes the tower. In reality, since zoning restrictions limit the height of most buildings in Paris to seven storeys, only a small number of tall buildings have a clear view of the tower. Maintenance of the tower includes applying 60 tons of paint every 7 years to prevent it from . The tower has been completely repainted at least 19 times since it was built, with the most recent being in 2010. was still being used as recently as 2001 when the practice was stopped out of concern for the environment. Top of the Eiffel Tower with antennas The tower has been used for making radio transmissions since the beginning of the 20th century. Until the 1950s, sets of aerial wires ran from the and Champ de Mars. These were connected to transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the , using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the , which used an aerial in . The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C. Today, radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower. A television antenna was first installed on the tower in 1957, increasing its height by 18.7 m (61 ft). Work carried out in 2000 added a further 5.3 m (17 ft), giving a total height of 324 m (1,063 ft). Analogue television signals from the Eiffel Tower ceased on 8 March 2011. The pinnacle height of the Eiffel Tower has changed multiple times over the years as described in the chart below.

Panorama of Paris and its suburbs from the top of the Eiffel Tower The Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest structure when completed in 1889, a distinction it retained until 1929 when the in New York City was topped out. The tower also lost its standing as the world's tallest tower to the in 1958 but retains its status as the tallest freestanding (non-guyed) structure in France. Lattice towers taller than the Eiffel Tower List of tallest towers in the world Structures in France taller than the Eiffel Tower List of tallest structures in France Spare transmission mast for longwave; insulated against ground The tower itself is located at the intersection of the quai Branly and the Number of visitors per year between 1889 and 2004 More than 300 million people have visited the tower since it was completed in 1889. In 2015, there were 6.91 million visitors. The tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world. An average of 25,000 people ascend the tower every day (which can result in long queues). The Eiffel Tower illuminated in 2012 The tower and its image have been in the since 1993, 70 years after Eiffel's death. In June 1990, a French court ruled that a special lighting display on the tower in 1989 to mark the tower's 100th anniversary was an \"original visual creation\" protected by copyright. The , France's judicial court of last resort, upheld the ruling in March 1992. Société d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SETE) now considers any illumination of the tower to be a separate work of art that falls under copyright. As a result, the SNTE alleges that it is illegal to publish contemporary photographs of the lit tower at night without permission in France and some other countries for commercial use. For this reason, it is often rare to find images or videos of the lit tower at night on stock image sites, and media outlets rarely broadcast images or videos of it. The imposition of copyright has been controversial. The Director of Documentation for what was then called the Société Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SNTE), Stéphane Dieu, commented in 2005: \"It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image, so that it isn't used in ways [of which] we don't approve\". SNTE made over €1 million from copyright fees in 2002. However, it could also be used to restrict the publication of tourist photographs of the tower at night, as well as hindering non-profit and semi-commercial publication of images of the illuminated tower. The copyright claim itself has never been tested in courts to date, according to a 2014 article in the , and there has never been an attempt to track down millions of people who have posted and shared their images of the illuminated tower on the Internet worldwide. However, the article adds that commercial uses of such images, like in a magazine, on a film poster, or on product packaging, may require prior permission. French doctrine and jurisprudence allows pictures incorporating a copyrighted work as long as their presence is incidental or accessory to the subject being represented, rule. Therefore, SETE may be unable to claim copyright on photographs of Paris which happen to include the lit tower. As one of the most famous landmarks in the world, the Eiffel Tower has been the inspiration for the creation of many replicas and similar towers. An early example is in England. The mayor of Blackpool, Sir John Bickerstaffe, was so impressed on seeing the Eiffel Tower at the 1889 exposition that he commissioned a similar tower to be built in his town. It opened in 1894 and is 158.1 m (519 ft) tall. in Japan, built as a communications tower in 1958, was also inspired by the Eiffel Tower. There are various scale models of the tower in the United States, including a half-scale version at the , Nevada, one in Paris, Texas built in 1993, and two 1:3 scale models at , amusement parks opened in 1972 and 1975 respectively. Two 1:3 scale models can be found in China, one in that was donated by the local French community, and several across Europe. speculated that a full-size replica of the tower would cost approximately US$480 million to build. This would be more than ten times the cost of the original (nearly 8 million in 1890 francs; around US$40 million in 2018 dollars).

Les bases des quatre piliers sont abritées dans des soubassements carrés de 25 mètres de côté et de 4 mètres de hauteur, composés d'une ossature en fer et de pierres factices en béton comprimé. Ils furent réalisés du De nos jours, les caisses pour l'achat des billets occupent les piliers nord et ouest, les ascenseurs sont accessibles depuis les piliers est et ouest. Les escaliers (ouverts au public jusqu'au deuxième étage, et comprenant au total 1 665 marches jusqu'au sommet) sont accessibles depuis le pilier est. Et enfin, le pilier sud comprend un ascenseur privé, réservé au personnel et aux clients du restaurant gastronomique L'un des arcs de la tour Eiffel  ( Arc et envol de la tour Eiffel ( Tendus entre chacun des quatre piliers, les arcs s'élèvent à 39 mètres au-dessus du sol et ont un diamètre de 74 mètres. Bien que très richement décorés sur les croquis initiaux de Harry Bellod, ils le sont beaucoup moins de nos jours. Leur rôle est « purement décoratif » Le premier étage vu depuis la base. Situé à 57 mètres au-dessus du sol, d'une superficie de 4 220 mètres carrés environ, le premier étage peut supporter la présence simultanée d'environ 2 500 personnes. Une galerie circulaire fait le tour du premier étage et permet d'embrasser une vue à sur Paris. Cette galerie est ponctuée de plusieurs permettant d'observer les monuments parisiens. Face à l'extérieur sont inscrits en lettres d'or les noms de siècles (Français ayant vécu entre 1789 et 1889). Ce premier étage abrite le restaurant qui s'étend sur deux niveaux. Celui-ci offre d'un côté une vue panoramique sur Paris, et de l'autre une vue sur l'intérieur de la tour. On peut également voir certains vestiges liés à l'histoire de la tour Eiffel, notamment un tronçon de l' qui, à l'origine du monument, montait jusqu'au sommet. Cet escalier a été démonté en 1986, lors des très importants travaux de rénovation de la tour. Il a été ensuite découpé en 22 tronçons dont 21 ont été vendus aux enchères, et achetés pour la plupart par des collectionneurs américains. Enfin, un observatoire des mouvements du sommet permet de retracer les oscillations de la tour sous l'effet du vent et de la dilatation thermique. Gustave Eiffel avait exigé qu'elle puisse supporter une amplitude de 70 centimètres, ce qui ne fut jamais le cas puisque dans les faits, lors de la canicule de , l'amplitude de l'oscillation a été de 18 ). Pierre Affaticati et Simon Pierrat ont d'ailleurs su remédier à ce problème d'amplitude en 1982 en incorporant des matériaux composites à l'armature connexe. Une des particularités de la tour est qu'elle « fuit le Soleil ». En effet, la chaleur étant plus importante du côté ensoleillé, le fer se dilate de ce côté et le sommet s'oriente légèrement à l'opposé. Le deuxième étage de la tour Eiffel vu depuis le parvis. Situé à 115 mètres au-dessus du sol, d'une superficie de 1 650 mètres carrés environ, le deuxième étage peut supporter la présence simultanée d'environ 1 600 personnes. De cet étage, l'altitude est optimale pour apercevoir les bâtiments en contrebas, qui sont en effet moins visibles au troisième étage, et par rapport à la perspective générale, nécessairement plus limitée au premier étage. À travers le plancher, des hublots vitrés ont été installés afin de permettre une vue plongeante sur le sol en contrebas. Des grillages métalliques de protection sont présents afin d'empêcher toute tentative de saut dans le vide, qu'il s'agisse d'un suicide ou d'un exploit sportif. se situe également à cet étage depuis 2019 après une rénovation menée par l'architecte d'intérieur . Il dispose de 95 couverts et, contrairement à son voisin du premier étage, est accessible à ses clients par un ascenseur privé, situé dans le pilier sud de la tour. D'un standing plus élevé que , il est noté deux étoiles au La tour Eiffel illuminée la nuit. Situé à 276,13 mètres au-dessus du sol, d'une superficie de 350 mètres carrés, le troisième étage peut supporter la présence simultanée d'environ 400 personnes. L'accès se fait obligatoirement par un ascenseur (l'escalier est interdit au public à partir du deuxième étage) et donne sur un espace fermé ponctué de tables d'orientation. En montant quelques marches, le visiteur arrive ensuite sur une plate-forme extérieure, parfois dénommée « quatrième étage », culminant à près de 279 On peut apercevoir à cet étage une reconstitution du type « , qui renforce l'idée selon laquelle Gustave Eiffel aurait utilisé l'endroit comme bureau. La réalité historique est différente : l'endroit a d'abord été occupé par le laboratoire météorologique, puis dès 1903 par Première expérimentation de TSF au sommet de la tour par Troisième étage de la Tour Eiffel, avec en son sommet le mât de télédiffusion, le 13 janvier 2008. Tout en haut de la tour, un mât de télédiffusion a été installé en 1957, puis complété en 1959 pour couvrir environ 10 millions de foyers en , le dispositif a été complété par le premier émetteur français, portant à 116 le nombre d'antennes de télédiffusion et radiodiffusion de l'ensemble. , une nouvelle antenne compatible avec le réseau au sommet de la tour, la faisant ainsi passer de 324 à 330 mètres de hauteur est le premier projet crédible d'une tour d'environ 300 mètres, imaginé en 1874 pour l' Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations , 1851), les gouvernants s'aperçoivent que derrière l'enjeu technologique se profile une vitrine politique dont il serait dommage de ne pas profiter. En démontrant son savoir-faire industriel, le pays accueillant l'exposition signifie son avance et sa supériorité sur les autres puissances européennes qui règnent alors sur le monde. Dans cette optique, la France accueille à plusieurs reprises l'Exposition universelle, comme en 1855, 1867 et 1878. de 1883 à 1885, décide de relancer l'idée d'une nouvelle exposition universelle en France. Le instituant officiellement la tenue d'une exposition universelle à Paris, du 5 mai au 31 octobre 1889. L'année choisie n'est pas innocente, puisqu'elle symbolise le centenaire de la que naît l'idée d'une tour de 300 mètres : lors de l' exposition universelle de Philadelphie en 1876 , les ingénieurs américains Clarke et Reeves imaginent un projet de pylône cylindrique de 9 mètres de diamètre maintenu par des métalliques, ancrés sur une base circulaire de 45 mètres de diamètre, d'une hauteur totale de 1 000 pieds (environ 300 mètres) , ce projet ne voit pas le jour, mais il est décrit en France dans la revue À partir d'une idée émise aux États-Unis de « tour-soleil » en fer éclairant Paris, l’ingénieur français Amédée Sébillot et l’architecte , qui a été à l’origine du , conçoivent un projet de « tour-phare » en , haute de 300 mètres. Cette tour, concurrente de celle de Gustave Eiffel, connaît plusieurs versions, mais ne sera jamais construite.\n",
            "Parmi les projets examinés, celui de Clarke et Reeves était le plus réalisable. Il restait à Eiffel à construire la première tour à partir de ces proportions Premier croquis du pylône de 300 mètres qui deviendra plus tard la tour Eiffel, réalisé par , constatant une similitude entre les pieds de la tour et le , voudrait que Gustave Eiffel soit l'inventeur de ce sous-vêtement . Selon une autre légende, il aurait donné à la tour une forme évoquant la lettre A, symbole de son amour de jeunesse, Adrienne Bourgès En juin 1884, deux ingénieurs des entreprises Eiffel, , respectivement chef du bureau d’études et directeur des études techniques et des montages, se penchent à leur tour sur un projet de tour métallique de 300 mètres. Ils espèrent pouvoir en faire le clou de l’Exposition de 1889. Le 6 juin, Émile Nouguier et Maurice Koechlin dessinent le premier croquis de l’édifice. Le dessin représente un haut de 300 mètres, dont les quatre piles incurvées, se rejoignant au sommet, sont reliées par des plates-formes tous les 50 mètres. Gustave Eiffel voit cette esquisse, dit ne pas s’y intéresser , mais concède toutefois à ses concepteurs l’autorisation de poursuivre l’étude. en chef des entreprises Eiffel, est sollicité et redessine complètement le projet pour lui donner une autre envergure : il rajoute de lourds pieds en et consolide la tour jusqu’au premier étage par le d’arcs, réduit le nombre de plates-formes de cinq à deux, surplombe la tour d’une « coiffe » la faisant ressembler à un Cette nouvelle mouture du projet est à nouveau présentée à Gustave Eiffel qui, cette fois-ci, se montre enthousiasmé. À tel point qu’il dépose, le , en son nom et ceux de Koechlin et Nouguier, un brevet « pour une disposition nouvelle permettant de construire des piles et des pylônes métalliques d’une hauteur pouvant dépasser 300 mètres ». Et bien vite, il rachètera les droits de Koechlin et Nouguier, pour détenir les droits exclusifs sur la future tour, qui, par voie de conséquence, portera son nom. n'a donc pas conçu le monument, mais s'est appliqué à faire connaître son projet auprès des gouvernants, des décideurs et du grand public, pour pouvoir construire la tour, puis, une fois que cela fut fait, à en faire, aux yeux de tous, plus qu’un simple défi architectural et technique ou encore un objet purement esthétique (ou inesthétique selon certains). Il a aussi financé avec ses propres fonds quelques expériences scientifiques menées directement sur ou depuis la tour Eiffel, qui auront permis de la pérenniser. En 1885, le projet est présenté à la , pour un devis initial total de 3 155 000 francs incluant fondations, ascenseurs et leurs moteurs en 1887, avant la construction de la Tour Eiffel. Photographie par Pour commencer, il va s’employer à convaincre , le ministre de l’Industrie et du Commerce de l’époque, de lancer un concours ayant pour objet « d’étudier la possibilité d’élever sur le une tour en fer à base carrée de 125 mètres de côté à la base et de 300 mètres de hauteur ». Les modalités de ce concours, qui a lieu en mai 1886, ressemblent beaucoup au projet défendu par Gustave Eiffel, même si ce dernier ne les a pas écrites. Grâce à cette similitude, son projet a de grandes chances d’être retenu pour figurer à l’Exposition universelle qui se tient trois ans plus tard . Encore faut-il convaincre que l’objet n’est pas purement un bâtiment d’agrément et qu’il peut remplir d’autres fonctions. En mettant en avant l’intérêt scientifique qui peut être retiré de sa tour, Eiffel marque des points. L’issue du concours n’est pourtant pas acquise d’avance à Eiffel. La concurrence est rude avec 107 projets déposés. Gustave Eiffel gagne finalement ce concours, l’autorisant à construire sa tour pour l’Exposition universelle de 1889, juste devant Jules Bourdais qui avait entre-temps, troqué le granit pour le qui précise l’emplacement, ainsi que les modalités de construction et d’exploitation de la Tour de 300 mètres. Deux problèmes se posent alors : le système d’ qui ne satisfait pas le jury du concours, obligeant Eiffel à changer de fournisseur, et l’emplacement du monument. Au début, il est envisagé de lui faire enjamber la ou de le coller à l' , situé à l'emplacement de l'actuel , avant finalement de décider de la placer directement sur le , lieu de l’Exposition, et d’en faire une sorte de porte d’entrée monumentale. L’emplacement, mais aussi les modalités de construction et d’exploitation font l’objet d’ entre Édouard Lockroy, ministre du Commerce, agissant au nom de l’État français, , agissant ici au nom de la ville de Paris et Gustave Eiffel, agissant en son nom propre . Cet acte officiel précise notamment le coût prévisionnel de la construction, soit 6,5 millions de francs de l’époque, au double du devis initial , payés à hauteur de 1,5 million de francs par des (article 7) et pour le reste par une ayant pour objet spécifique l’exploitation de la tour Eiffel, créée par Gustave Eiffel et financée par l’ingénieur et un consortium de trois . L’écrit précise aussi le prix des entrées qui devra être pratiqué durant l’Exposition universelle (article 7), et que, à chaque étage, une salle spéciale, devra être réservée, pour mener des expériences scientifiques et/ou militaires, restant gratuitement à disposition pour les personnes désignées par le Commissaire général (article 8), Enfin, l’article 11 stipule qu'après l’Exposition, Paris deviendra propriétaire de la tour, mais que M. Eiffel, comme complément du prix des travaux, en conservera la jouissance pendant 20 ans — jusqu'au — délai au bout duquel elle appartiendra à la Aperçu des différentes étapes de la construction de la tour Eiffel : Animation d'octobre 1887 à avril 1889 clichés de Jules Théophile Féau (1839-1892) 18 juillet 1887 : commencement du montage métallique de la pile 7 décembre 1887 : montage de la partie inférieure sur les pylônes en charpente. 20 mars 1888 : montage des poutres horizontales sur l'échafaudage du milieu. 15 mai 1888 : montage des piliers au-dessus du premier étage. 21 août 1888 : montage de la deuxième plate-forme. 26 décembre 1888 : montage de la partie supérieure. 15 mars 1889 : montage du campanile. Fin mars 1889 : vue générale de l'ouvrage achevé. Initialement, Gustave Eiffel (ingénieur passé maître dans l'architecture du fer) avait prévu douze mois de travaux ; en réalité, il faudra en compter le double. La phase de construction qui débute le , s’achèvera finalement en mars 1889, juste avant l’ouverture officielle de l’Exposition universelle. Sur le chantier, le nombre d’ ne dépassera jamais 250. C’est que, en fait, une grande partie du travail est fait en amont, dans les usines des entreprises Eiffel à . Ainsi, sur les 2 500 000 que compte la tour, seulement 1 050 846 ont été posés sur le chantier, soit 42 % du total. La plupart des éléments sont assemblés dans les ateliers de Levallois-Perret, au sol, par tronçons de cinq mètres, avec des provisoires, et ce n’est qu’après, sur le chantier, qu’ils sont définitivement remplacés par des rivets posés à chaud. Maçonnerie de la tour Eiffel en 1887. Photographie par La construction des pièces et leur assemblage ne sont pas le fruit du hasard. Cinquante ingénieurs exécutent pendant deux ans 5 300 dessins d’ensemble ou de détails, et chacune des 18 038 pièces en fer possédait son schéma descriptif. Sur le chantier, dans un premier temps, les ouvriers s’attaquent à la en réalisant notamment d’énormes socles en béton soutenant les quatre piliers de l’édifice. Cela permet de minimiser la pression au sol de l’ensemble qui n'exerce qu'une très faible poussée de 4,5 kg/cm Construction de la tour Eiffel en janvier 1888 (peinture de Le montage de la partie métallique proprement dite commence le juillet 1887. Les hommes chargés de ce montage sont nommés les voltigeurs et sont dirigés par . Jusqu’à 30 mètres de hauteur, les pièces sont montées à l’aide de pivotantes fixées sur le chemin des ascenseurs. Entre 30 et 45 mètres de hauteur, 12 sont construits. Une fois passés les 45 mètres de hauteur, il fallut édifier de nouveaux échafaudages, adaptés aux poutres de 70 tonnes qui furent utilisées pour le premier étage. Est ensuite venue l’heure de la jonction de ces énormes poutres avec les quatre arêtes, au niveau du premier étage. Cette jonction a été réalisée sans encombre le et a rendu inutiles les échafaudages temporaires, remplacés dans un premier temps par la première plate-forme (57 mètres), puis, à partir d’août 1888, par la seconde plate-forme (115 mètres). Ouvriers escaladant la Tour Eiffel (1889) En septembre 1888, alors que le chantier est déjà bien avancé et le deuxième étage construit, les ouvriers se mettent en . Ils contestent les horaires de travail (9 heures en hiver et 12 heures l’été), ainsi que leur salaire considéré insuffisant eu égard aux risques pris. Gustave Eiffel argue du fait que le risque n’est pas différent qu’ils travaillent à 200 mètres d’altitude ou à 50, et bien que les ouvriers soient déjà mieux rémunérés que la moyenne de ce qui se pratiquait dans ce secteur à l’époque, il leur concède une augmentation de salaire, tout en refusant de l’indexer sur le facteur « risque variable selon la hauteur » demandé par les ouvriers.\n",
            "Trois mois plus tard, une nouvelle grève éclate mais cette fois-ci, Eiffel tient tête et refuse toute négociation.

Contrairement à plusieurs idées reçues, le fer utilisé par les forges provient également de , plus précisément des mines de Les éléments de structure de la tour Eiffel sont peints avant son montage en Venise puis à son inauguration en 1889, l'édifice est recouvert d'une épaisse couche de rouge, « avant de connaître, au fil des années, différentes teintes » - Gustave Eiffel ayant écrit que le bâtiment a été conçu de façon à rendre ses parties accessibles « afin de pouvoir faire en tout temps des visites destinées à reconnaître un commencement de rouille et à y remédier » Depuis 1968, lors de sa trente-cinquième campagne de peinture, la couleur choisie et qui demeure est le brun En 1995, la tour est pour la première fois Depuis 2018, débute une nouvelle campagne de rénovation et peinture devant se terminer en 2024 Transports durant les travaux de l'exposition universelle de 1889 En mars 1889, le monument est achevé à temps et aucun accident mortel n'a été déploré parmi les ouvriers (un ouvrier y trouve toutefois la mort un dimanche ; il ne travaillait pas et perd l'équilibre lors d'une démonstration à sa fiancée). La tour Eiffel a coûté 7 799 401,31 francs soit environ 1,5 million de francs de plus que prévu, et a pris le double du temps à être construit que ce qui était initialement prévu dans la convention de janvier 1887. Cela représente aussi plus du double du devis initial d'Eiffel présenté à la Société des Ingénieurs Civils, en 1885 Tour Eiffel de 1889 à la Première Guerre mondiale Manifestation devant la tour Eiffel, rappelant le rôle des aciéries lorraines (2012) Exposition universelle de Paris de 1889 à l'occasion de laquelle la tour Eiffel fut construite.

Alors qu’elle avait été décriée pendant sa construction, elle connaît, pendant l’Exposition, un succès populaire immédiat. Dès la première semaine, alors que les ascenseurs ne sont même pas encore en service, ce sont 28 922 personnes qui grimpent à pied en haut de l’édifice. Finalement, sur les 32 millions d’entrées comptabilisées pour l’Exposition, ce sont environ 2 millions de curieux qui s’y presseront. Le monument, qui est alors le plus haut du monde (jusqu’en ), attire aussi quelques personnalités, dont Mais, une fois l’Exposition finie, la curiosité retombe vite et le nombre de visiteurs avec elle. En 1899, seules 149 580 entrées sont comptabilisées. Afin de relancer l’exploitation commerciale de sa tour, Gustave Eiffel baisse le prix des billets d’entrée, sans que l’impact soit significatif. Il faut attendre l’ à Paris, pour que remonte le nombre de curieux. À cette occasion, plus d’un million de tickets sont vendus, ce qui est largement supérieur aux dix années précédentes, mais bien inférieur à ce qui aurait pu être permis. En effet, non seulement les entrées sont deux fois moins nombreuses qu’en 1889, mais, en part absolue, la baisse est encore plus forte, compte tenu du fait que les visiteurs de l’Exposition universelle de 1900 sont encore plus nombreux qu’en 1889. La chute du nombre d’entrées reprend dès 1901, de sorte que l’avenir de la tour n’est pas assuré, passé le , date de la fin de la concession d’origine.

Alors que la n’en est qu’à ses balbutiements, il accepte l'installation d'une antenne au sommet de sa tour, l'expérience est couronnée de succès. La tour Eiffel a donc un potentiel scientifique qui mérite d’être exploité : les autorités décident, en 1910, de prolonger la concession et l’exploitation pour soixante-dix années supplémentaires. La tour apparaît d’autant plus utile qu’il s’agit du point le plus élevé de la région parisienne et que son émetteur de TSF aura été stratégique pendant la . Grâce à la tour Eiffel, plusieurs messages décisifs sont captés dont le « radiogramme de la victoire », permettant de déjouer l’ , et ceux conduisant à l'arrestation de À partir des années 1920, le réseau de TSF à usage strictement militaire dont fait partie l’émetteur de la tour Eiffel bascule vers un usage civil.

Au contraire des exemples précédents, La Tour Eiffel de Robert Delaunay , relate, via le témoignage d'un gardien, le suicide d'une inconnue ayant sauté du On a pu lire ailleurs : « ce lampadaire véritablement tragique » ( « ce squelette de beffroi » ( « ce mât de fer aux durs agrès, inachevé, confus, difforme » ( « cette haute et maigre pyramide d'échelles de fer, squelette disgracieux et géant, dont la base semble faite pour porter un formidable monument de Cyclopes, et qui avorte en un ridicule et mince profil de cheminée d'usine » ( « un tuyau d'usine en construction, une carcasse qui attend d'être remplie par des pierres de taille ou des briques, ce grillage infundibuliforme, ce suppositoire criblé de trous » ( Gustave Eiffel répondit à la protestation des artistes dans qui fut reproduit dans le même numéro du journal , à la suite de la protestation qui pourrait avoir été rédigée par un obscur fonctionnaire nommé Georges Moineaux, qui deviendra célèbre sous le nom de « Cette page bien française a dû étonner quelque peu les expéditionnaires du ministère ; la correspondance administrative n'est malheureusement d'ordinaire ni si vive, ni si gaie, ni si spirituelle ; sa sévérité s'accommode mal à nos vieilles traditions gauloises. Si M. Lockroy pouvait faire école, l'exercice des fonctions publiques serait moins monotone et certainement mieux apprécié. Le ministre avait su mettre les rieurs de son côté. Son procès était gagné. » La tour Eiffel a attiré les foules après son inauguration, faisant, petit à petit, taire les réticences. Ainsi, deux ans après avoir signé la « protestation des artistes », un discours favorable à la tour Représentation de la tour Eiffel dans la peinture Avant même la fin de la construction, , le peintre Roux la représente à la Fête de nuit à l’Exposition universelle de 1889 la fait apparaître en arrière-plan de son Puis plusieurs peintres viendront directement s'en inspirer : le Mais le peintre le plus prolifique et inspiré vis-à-vis de la tour Eiffel reste , qui en fait le sujet central d'une trentaine de toiles, réalisées entre musée des beaux-arts de San Francisco La tour Eiffel vue de la Seine Représentation de la tour Eiffel dans la littérature Au moment de son édification et au tout début de son exploitation, le monument a avant toute chose fait l’objet d’analyses critiques personnelles, le plus souvent publiées dans des journaux de l’époque et le plus souvent négatives, les artistes abordant les thèmes récurrents du défi technique, industriel et commercial que la tour représentait à l’époque, de son influence sur le rayonnement de la France à l’étranger, l’aspect esthétique ou au contraire inesthétique de la tour ou encore de son intérêt scientifique potentiel ou au contraire de son inutilité. Par la suite, devant le succès populaire qu’elle a remporté auprès du grand public, un grand nombre d’écrivains ont revu leurs considérations, balayant leurs dernières réserves. décrit ce sentiment d'attrait/répulsion des artistes vis-à-vis de la tour Eiffel : « Regard, objet, symbole, la tour est tout ce que l’homme met en elle, et ce tout est infini. Spectacle regardé et regardant, édifice inutile et irremplaçable, monde familier et symbole héroïque, témoin d’un siècle et monument toujours neuf, objet inimitable et sans cesse reproduit, elle est le signe pur, ouvert à tous les temps, à toutes les images et à tous les sens, la métaphore sans frein ; à travers la tour, les hommes exercent cette grande fonction de l’imaginaire, qui est leur liberté ; puisque aucune histoire, si sombre soit-elle, n’a jamais pu la leur enlever. » revient sur l’analyse critique de ses pairs, sur la tour à ses débuts ( , qui tout en rappelant qu’au départ, pour les artistes, « vitupérer contre la tour […] était un brevet de sensibilité littéraire et artistique », souligne l’intérêt scientifique et militaire qui a ensuite été reconnu à la tour ( La Tour, Javel et les Bélandres, Villes aborde l’histoire de la conception, de la construction et des premières années d’exploitation de la tour à travers une narration romancée ( Le Mystère de la tour Eiffel ).

Le monument du Champ-de-Mars a également été traité sous des formes particulières : journal ( , tome VIII, 6 mai et 2 juillet 1889), récit de voyage ( ), où l’écrivain dit son dégoût de la tour Eiffel (dès les premières lignes, le ton est donné : « J’ai quitté Paris et même la France, parce que la tour Eiffel finissait par m’ennuyer trop »), étude ), mais aussi préface de livres, discours à une conférence, article dans une revue, etc. La tour est également largement évoquée dans le roman d' , publié en 1988 ; le chapitre 116 lui est presque entièrement consacré. Représentation de la tour Eiffel au cinéma et à la télévision Dès que l'ingénierie cinématographique commença à se développer, la tour Eiffel fut filmée par les cinéastes les plus illustres. Ainsi, dès , soit seulement 8 ans après son inauguration, Panorama pendant l'ascension de la tour Eiffel pour le diffuser au public dans sa salle de projection parisienne. Un autre pionnier du cinéma, La tour Eiffel trouve sa première consécration dans une œuvre de fiction avec les premiers , soit 5 films d'action réalisés durant les années est alors le maître de la tour Eiffel. Scène se déroulant sur la tour Eiffel dans le film réalise la première fiction ayant la tour Eiffel pour personnage principal. Dans ce court film (35 minutes), un scientifique plonge dans le sommeil. Une poignée d'hommes et de femmes qui se réfugient dans les hauteurs de la tour Eiffel échappent au sort réservé aux autres habitants de la capitale. La tour Eiffel devient alors un lieu magique qui offre sa protection à ces heureux individus. Le réalisateur français récidivera en , mais cette fois-ci sous forme de documentaire. Pendant les 14 minutes que dure cette œuvre, il explore toutes les possibilités de la caméra et montre le monument sous toutes ses coutures. Par là même, il signe une sorte de déclaration d'amour à cet édifice qui l'inspire tant. pousse encore les recherches pour mettre en valeur l'esthétisme des structures de la tour. connaît un des plus grands succès de sa carrière avec le film . La camarade russe Ninotchka, jouée par , arrive en mission à Paris. En chemin vers la tour Eiffel, elle rencontre un Français ( ) avec lequel elle vivra une aventure sentimentale qui prendra de plus en plus d'ampleur à chaque étage franchi de la tour. La plupart des vues de la tour Eiffel sont réalisées en studio et non sur place. La célèbre scène du cocktail associera à jamais l'image du à celle de la tour Eiffel et comme l'explique le scénariste du film, , à la suite de ce film, aura tendance à adopter l'enchaînement d'une bouteille de champagne à la tour Eiffel pour chaque scène se déroulant à Paris. Mais avant toute chose, la tour Eiffel deviendra au fil du temps, le symbole visuel de Paris et de la France. met furtivement en scène la tour Eiffel pendant l'histoire romantique se passant à Paris entre ). Le cinéma américain sera également très friand d'apparitions de la tour, notamment pour l'effet pratique et symbolique. Elle permet en effet de signifier en un seul plan ou une seule séquence, même courte, que l'action se situe en France ou à Paris. Ainsi, dès la montre détruite dans son adaptation de . Ce genre d'images (la tour Eiffel détruite) sera par la suite souvent utilisée dans des films américains pour signifier un danger planétaire immédiat et grave, comme en Les apparitions cinématographiques de ce symbole de Paris sont impossibles à comptabiliser, mais l'expert en cinéma Luc Lagier a réalisé un catalogue vidéo des apparitions les plus marquantes de la dame de fer au septième art pour l'émission Représentation de la tour Eiffel dans l'art et la culture Vue photographique sous la tour Eiffel Recenser de manière exhaustive les évocations de la tour dans l'art ou la culture serait impossible. La construction de la tour a accompagné le développement de certaines formes d'art, comme la ont également largement utilisé la tour, de la silhouette aux détails structurels, afin d'évoquer l' Enfin, si les formes d'expression plus traditionnelles, comme le théâtre et à l'opéra, se sont librement emparées de la tour, son utilisation y est restée plus confidentielle que d'autres, plus modernes, comme les est le « plus haut bâtiment du monde », avant que la tour Eiffel prenne cette place. À son inauguration, la tour Eiffel est la structure la plus haute au monde avec ses 300 mètres. Elle dépasse de 130 mètres la précédente plus haute structure au monde, l' , et conserve sa première place pendant environ 40 ans (la a détenu ce record pendant environ 4 000 ans), jusqu'en 1930, où elle est dépassée par le Projet de colonne monumentale de plus de 300 mètres de , concurrente de la Tour Eiffel La pierre ne permet pas de dépasser une certaine hauteur. L'obélisque de Washington en est la preuve. Il était prévu à l'origine que le monument, fait de marbre, de grès et de granit, atteigne 180 mètres de hauteur. Achevé le , et officiellement ouvert au public le , il mesure 169 mètres, soit 10 de moins que prévu. C'est alors la plus haute structure du monde. La technique du fer permet ensuite de dépasser cette limite. Que ce soit en Angleterre, en France ou aux États-Unis, les projets vont se multiplier pour atteindre l'objectif de 300 mètres. En 1833, , propose un projet de colonne en ajourée, haute de 1 000 pieds (≈ 300 mètres). En France, dans les années 1880, le principal concurrent de Gustave Eiffel est , qui a imaginé et construit, avec Gabriel Davioud, le , dans le cadre de l' . Bourdais imagine d'abord une tour de 300 mètres en , mais le projet ne prenant pas assez en compte le problème de la résistance des matériaux, ce matériau sera finalement remplacé par le fer en 1886, lors du concours qui l'oppose à Gustave Eiffel pour construire une tour de 300 mètres pour l'Exposition universelle de 1889. Si Jules Bourdais est resté connu comme un concurrent sérieux d'Eiffel, c'est qu'il a su promouvoir, comme son adversaire, son projet de tour auprès des hommes politiques, des médias et du grand public. 107 projets sont déposés lors de ce concours. Même s'ils ne semblent pas tous réalistes, cela prouve que Gustave Eiffel est loin d'être le seul ingénieur à avoir planché sur ce projet de très haute tour. Place de la tour Eiffel parmi les plus hauts bâtiments de 1889 En 1889, avant que la tour Eiffel ne soit officiellement achevée, seules trois structures dépassaient 150 mètres, soit la moitié de sa hauteur : la (169 mètres). Avec ses 300 mètres, la tour Eiffel dépasse donc largement tous les autres grands bâtiments du monde existants à l'époque File d'attente de visiteurs de la Tour Eiffel. Jeton souvenir de l'ascension automatique de la tour Eiffel, début du Après le succès populaire pendant l’ Exposition universelle de Paris de 1889 , le nombre de visiteurs ne décollera qu’une fois la Ainsi, entre 1901 et 1914, entre 120 000 et 260 000 personnes en font l’ascension chaque année. De inclus, elle est fermée du fait de la , la tour Eiffel attire en moyenne 480 000 visiteurs par an avec des pics à 800 000 entrées pendant l’ inclus, elle est de nouveau fermée pour cause de Seconde Guerre mondiale. Une fois cette période passée, le nombre de visiteurs annuels ne cessera d’augmenter : 1 300 000 en moyenne de et ce n’est véritablement qu’à partir de que les entrées se développent, notamment grâce à l’essor du international. En effet, en 1963, la tour Eiffel repasse pour la première fois le cap des 2 millions de visiteurs, soit le même que pour son année inaugurale soixante-quatorze ans plus tôt, à la différence majeure que cette fois-ci, ce cap symbolique de 2 millions d’entrées sera amélioré chaque année. En le cap des 3 millions d’entrées est dépassé, en 1984 c’est celui des 4 millions, en celui des 5 millions, et enfin en 1998 celui des 6 millions. À l’heure actuelle, ce sont donc plus de 300 millions de visiteurs qui ont foulé de leurs pieds la tour Eiffel (palier atteint le , la tour Eiffel est le cinquième monument le plus visité d'Île-de-France en 2004 avec 6 229 993 visiteurs, derrière Propriété de l'État français pendant l' , la tour Eiffel est ensuite devenue propriété de la Article 11 de la convention du 8 janvier 1887 devient (en son nom propre) l'exploitant de la tour Eiffel. Il possède la jouissance commerciale de la tour pour une durée de vingt ans, du janvier 1890 au 31 décembre 1909, après quoi, l'édifice est susceptible d'être détruit. Devant l'intérêt scientifique reconnu au monument, Gustave Eiffel obtient une prolongation de son autorisation d'exploiter commercialement la tour Eiffel, à partir du janvier 1910 et pour une période de 70 ans supplémentaires. La gestion du monument a ensuite été confiée, de 1980 à 2005, à la Société nouvelle d'exploitation de la tour Eiffel (SNTE) détenue à 30 % par Paris et à 70 % par la SAGI (Société anonyme de gestion immobilière), elle-même détenue à hauteur de 60 % par Perexia, une filiale du ) et à 40 % par Paris. décide la création d'une nouvelle société d'économie mixte, la Société d'exploitation de la tour Eiffel (SETE), détenue à hauteur de 60 % par Paris et à 40 % par des partenaires privés ( ), pour prendre le relais de la SNTE dans la gestion du monument dans le cadre d'une . Cette société doit être l'exploitant de la tour du La SETE emploie 362 personnes au La tour Eiffel a coûté 7,8 . L'État français a versé 1,5 million de francs-or sous forme de subventions et une a été spécialement créée à l'occasion de l'édification de la tour, avec un capital de 5,1 millions de francs-or. Cette société était détenue pour partie par Gustave Eiffel lui-même et pour partie par un de trois banques. Les bénéfices obtenus à l'issue de l'Exposition universelle de 1889 ont permis de rembourser intégralement le capital aux Selon une étude conduite par la en 2012, qui a évalué les monuments d'Europe les plus célèbres, la tour Eiffel aurait une image de marque d'une valeur virtuelle de 434 milliards d'euros, loin devant le de Rome (91 milliards d'euros) et la .\n",

Mais l'initiative provoque un tollé de nombreux artisans et Gustave Eiffel renonce à son idée initiale en abandonnant ses Ainsi, Gustave Eiffel s'est privé d'une source de revenus importante. L'exploitation commerciale de l'image sur les représentant la tour Eiffel aurait pu lui rapporter beaucoup d'argent. Avec plus de 5 milliards d'unités, en cumulé depuis 1889, les cartes postales représentant le monument sont les plus vendues au monde Mais Gustave Eiffel a une importante fortune personnelle et la seule exploitation commerciale des entrées lui rapporte suffisamment. La Société d'exploitation de la tour Eiffel (SETE) revendique des droits sur la publication de la tour illuminée, sans que cela soit confirmé par un jugement , en s'appuyant sur une décision de la du 3 mars 1992 relative à des illuminations mises en place en 1989, pour le centenaire de la tour. Selon la Cour, le spectacle son-et-lumière , et notamment « la composition de jeux de lumière destinés à révéler et à souligner les lignes et les formes du monument constituait une « création visuelle » originale, et, partant, une œuvre de l'esprit , alors maire de Paris, lance d'importants travaux de De 2008 à 2014, l’ascenseur du pilier ouest est rénové pour un coût global estimé à 36 millions d'euros campagne de peinture de la tour a lieu de 2009 à 2010 En 2010, un modèle numérique de la tour a été réalisé par le , pour la Société d'exploitation de la tour Eiffel. Grâce à ce modèle, il est possible de simuler le comportement de la structure en fonction des efforts appliqués (vent, gel, neige, poids des visiteurs), ou d'anticiper les conséquences des modifications et de mieux planifier l'entretien En 2012 et 2013, le premier étage de la tour est rénové par l'agence Moatti-Rivière. À cette occasion, le bord intérieur de l'étage sera prolongé par des dalles transparentes bordées par un vitré, afin de donner une vue sur le sol . Cette opération, financée en totalité par la Société d'exploitation de la tour Eiffel, a pour but d'augmenter la fréquentation du étage, les visiteurs ayant tendance à préférer les autres étages . La salle de réception et de conférence Gustave-Eiffel sera détruite puis reconstruite, afin de la moderniser et d'améliorer la vue depuis l'intérieur . Le pavillon Ferrié sera également détruit puis reconstruit En 2018, dans le cadre de sa vingtième campagne de peinture, la tour Eiffel fait l'objet d'un « » qui s'avère difficile par la présence de - agent anticorrosion de l'époque jusqu'en 1995 - dans les peintures et de , apparue à l'occasion du décapage dans l'enceinte du monument , la tour Eiffel bénéficie d'autres rénovations lancées en 2018, d'un montant de 60 millions d'euros, que le magazine désigne comme des travaux « cache-misère » .

Ces 20 000 crépitaient tous les jours pendant dix minutes à midi, et de la tombée de la nuit à une heure du matin, en plus de l’éclairage doré habituel, elles s’illuminaient pendant cinq minutes à chaque nouveau passage d’heure. Enfin, à une heure du matin, pour clore le spectacle, les ampoules brillaient pendant dix minutes, mais cette fois-ci seules, c’est-à-dire sans l’éclairage habituel de la tour.

            "The Eiffel Tower: Top Tips for Visitors The Eiffel Tower: Top Tips for Visitors The Eiffel Tower: Top Tips for Visitors A reservation can help you avoid the Eiffel Tower's long lines. (photo: Rick Steves) Paris views are better from the tower's second level than its very top, as you're closer to the city's rooftops. (photo: Cathy Lu) is one of the great travel thrills in Europe. Sure, it's crowded and expensive, and other spots in Paris offer (arguably) better views. But once you make the eye-popping ascent — and ear-popping descent — you'll be in the exclusive society of some 250 million people who have made the Eiffel Tower one of the most visited monuments in the world. The first visitors ascended in 1889, the year the Paris World's Fair opened with the tower as its grand centerpiece. Put together like an 18,000-piece erector set, made of iron beams held together with 2.5 million rivets, the tower was a pure showpiece, with no functional purpose. It was meant to demonstrate to the world that France had the know-how and money to erect the tallest structure in the world. Remarkably, the original plan was to dismantle the tower after 20 years. But designer Gustave Eiffel — an inveterate tinkerer — added a radio antenna and telegraph transmitters to the top, and the French government decided they'd made the tower too useful to tear down. (The French ended up using one of the transmitters to jam German radio communications during World War I.) To visit this 1,000-foot-tall ornament today, you'll battle crowds and pay about $30 per person (for the elevator to the top) — but it's well worth it. Here are my tips for making it fun, time-efficient, and memorable: Those who just show up with no prebooked ticket are likely to waste lots of time in the initial entry line — in summer, waits of one to two hours are the norm (weekends and holidays can be worse). That's a shame, especially when it's fast, easy, and free to . Be sure to reserve well ahead for peak times, which includes most of the summer; dates open up 60 days out (at 8:30 Paris time), and can sell out within hours. You'll need to take a few minutes to create an account (with your 10-digit mobile phone number as your login), and select your ticket according to how high up you'll go — and how. Ticket options include riding the elevators to the very top (I recommend getting this option; select \"Lift entrance ticket with access to the summit\"), riding only as far as the second level, or climbing the stairs to the first or second level (the top can only be reached by elevator). Be sure of your date, as reservations are nonrefundable. After paying with a credit card, you must either print your ticket (following the printing specifications carefully), or have the ticket's bar code texted to your smartphone. (Note that a ticket confirmation itself will not get you in — you must show your bar code, whether in print or on your phone — to be scanned when you enter.) If slots are booked up, don't despair. If you're not that set on going all the way to the tower's top, try selecting the option on the tower's website for \"Lift entrance ticket with access to 2nd floor\" only, as these tickets may still be available when the tickets to the summit have been snapped up. On shorter notice — often available fairly last-minute — you can buy a reservation time for the second level for about $65 by joining one of Fat Tire Tours' \"Skip the Line\" Eiffel Tower tours (price includes Eiffel Tower ticket to the second level). And you can bypass some (but not all) entry lines if you've booked a table at either of the tower's classy view restaurants ( If going to the summit is important to you, try again online about a week ahead of your visit, as last-minute slots occasionally open up. Without a reservation at all, try showing up early (about 30 minutes before the tower opens), late (after 7 p.m. May–August, after 5 p.m. in spring and fall, or after 4 p.m. in winter), or in less-than-ideal weather — lines evaporate in the rain. For the best of all worlds, plan to arrive close to sundown to see the views, then stay as it gets dark to see the lights. At the top of the hour, a five-minute display features thousands of sparkling lights lassoing the tower (best viewed from below, either from right across the river at Place du Trocadéro, or the grassy park just under the tower). However impressive it may be by day, the tower is an awesome thing to behold at twilight, when darkness fully envelops the city, and the tower is resplendent with its spectacular light show. And expect to be there for a while — in summer I'd budget three to four hours for the time it takes to wait in line, get to the top, and enjoy the views and exhibits on your way back down. (The quickest you could get to the top and back — with a reserved ticket, lesser crowds, and minimal sightseeing — would be about 90 minutes.) If you have a reserved entry time, arrive about 30 minutes ahead. Keep your valuables out of reach. Street thieves plunder awestruck visitors gawking below the tower, and tourists in crowded elevators are like fish in a barrel for predatory pickpockets. Wear a money belt or some other means of keeping your cash and cards tucked away under your clothes, and be thoughtful about where you keep your phone. The tower has three levels with observation platforms, at roughly 200, 400, and 900 feet, all connected by elevators and stairs. But there isn't a single elevator straight to the top To get there, you'll first ride an elevator (or climb 775 steps) to the second level. (Some elevators stop on the first level, but don't get off — it's more efficient to see the first level on the way down.) Once on the second level, immediately line up for the next elevator, to the top. (Look for the shortest line; there are several elevators and feeder queues.) Keep an eye out for the secret apartment! Few people realize that Gustave Eiffel built himself a little hideaway apartment on the top level of the tower. Eiffel used the plush space for quiet reflection and occasional visitors, and resisted all offers to rent it out. (Visitors can peer inside the still-furnished space.) The peak experience is halfway down. By all means, go to the top if you have the time (skip it if your schedule's tight). But I prefer to linger on the second floor: For me, the best views are from this middle level — high enough to see all of Paris, but low enough to pick out distinguishing landmarks. And don't skip the first level: Explore its shops and exhibits, then venture onto its vertigo-inducing glass floor to experience what it's like to stand atop an 18-story building. Save time by taking the stairs down. The tower is notorious for its elevator lines — both up and down. I'll tolerate the lines to ride the elevator up, but I prefer to take the stairs down. You'll need to take the elevator from the top down to the second level, but can use the stairs down from there. It takes about five minutes to walk between each level — much faster than the elevator line and a far more memorable way to return to earth.​ Once back on the ground, you'll appreciate the tower's romance and engineering even more. For a final look, stroll across the Seine River to Place du Trocadéro, and look back for great views of the defining symbol of Paris. ©2025 Rick Steves' Europe, Inc. | CST# 2086743 |\n",

There are just a few buildings in the world that evoke the same sense of awe, wonder, and romance as the Eiffel Tower. For many, a trip to Paris would be incomplete without a visit to this iconic landmark. In this guide, we uncover the best way to visit the Eiffel Tower, with tips on how to avoid a long wait in line, where to dine with a view, and whether or not it is worth it to visit all three levels. We visit Paris frequently and have visited the Eiffel Tower a handful of times. On our most recent visit (September 2023) we visited the Eiffel Tower twice, in the morning and at sunset, so we could write a comprehensive guide on how to visit the Eiffel Tower. 5 Tips for Visiting the Eiffel Tower Things to Do at the Eiffel Tower The Gardens and Champs de Mars How to Get to the Eiffel Tower Eiffel Tower Tickets & How to Skip the Line How to Skip the Line at the Eiffel Tower 3. Take the Lift or the Stairs 4. Time on the Eiffel Tower Best Time to Visit the Eiffel Tower Skip the Line Tours of the Eiffel Tower Interesting Facts about the Eiffel Tower 5 Tips for Visiting the Eiffel Tower Before we get into the history of the Eiffel Tower, things to do, ticket types, etc., here is a quick glance at the most important things to know when planning your visit. 1. For the best experience, book your tickets online in advance on the official website. This is the cheapest way to visit the Eiffel Tower and avoid a wait in line. Tickets go on sale 60 days in advance. 2. If tickets are sold out on the official website, consider booking a tour. Tours costs a little more but they save you a wait in the ticket line, which can be very long, especially in the summer. , which is basically a guided tour to the second level, one of the cheapest, quickest tours we found of the Eiffel Tower. 3. If you only have time for one level, the second level is the best. It’s the quickest to get to by elevator and the view is amazing. 4. If you want to add on a dining experience, Madame Brasserie is an upscale restaurant on the first level with a view of the Trocadero and Jules Verne is a Michelin-starred fine dining restaurant on the second level. Make your reservations in advance. 5. The Paris Museum Pass is not accepted at the Eiffel Tower. Things to Do at the Eiffel Tower The Eiffel Tower has three levels to visit, as well as a Michelin-starred restaurant (Jules Verne), an upscale restaurant (Madame Brasserie), plus a long list of cafes and souvenir shops. You can visit all three levels, or just one or two, traveling up and down the Eiffel Tower either by elevator or by taking the stairs. The Esplanade is the area that sits under the Eiffel Tower. This is where you will board the elevator or climb the stairs, purchase your tickets (if you did not do so in advance), or get a snack or drink at one of the cafes. The south pillar on the Esplanade Steps up from the Esplanade or elevator or steps down from the second floor. The first level is the largest level of the Eiffel Tower. On this level is a large outdoor terrace with a cocktail bar and café, (an upscale restaurant with a view of the Trocadéro), boutique souvenir shops, and a glass bottom floor. We had lunch at Madame Brasserie and recommend it if you want to spend some extra time on the Eiffel Tower. If you make a reservation in advance, request a window seat, where you get a great view of the Seine River and the Trocadéro. View from the first floor (photo taken near sunset). Another view from the first floor A lot of people skip this level. I do agree that the second level has the best view, but the view from the first level is also very nice. Since this level is so large, and gets less visitors, it also doesn’t feel as if it is packed with visitors. Steps or elevator from the Esplanade The second floor of the Eiffel Tower is where (in our opinion) you get the best view from the Eiffel Tower. You are just high enough to gaze across Paris, but not so high that feel like you are floating above the city. This level is just large enough that visitors can spread out. Second floor of the Eiffel Tower a Michelin-starred restaurant, is located on this level. This is the Eiffel Tower’s best dining experience, but you will need to at least a few months in advance. You can also shop in the souvenir shops or grab a bite to eat at The Buffet or the macaron shop. If you plan to take the elevator (rather than climbing the steps), from the Esplanade you will ride the elevator to the second level, bypassing the first level. Once your visit to the second level is finished, you can either ride the elevator to the 3rd or 1st levels. Elevator from the second floor (there are no steps to the third floor) The very top of the Eiffel Tower is the smallest, most crowded level. Visiting the third level requires an additional fee, or add-on to the standard Eiffel Tower ticket (more on this later). To get here, you will ride the elevator from the second level. There is usually a line for this, as the number of people on the third level is limited. Be prepared to wait in line for anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. The third level can periodically close due to weather conditions or elevator malfunctions (it closed during one of our visits). If this occurs, and you already paid for a ticket, your extra fee for the 3rd level will be refunded. On this top level, there are two sections. The lower level is enclosed in glass. Take the steps to the upper, outdoor level, so you can take better photos. You can also see Gustav Eiffel’s office and have a glass of champagne. This level, since it is so small, is very crowded. If you don’t want to spend the extra time or money, I don’t think it is worth going all of the way to the third level. The Arc de Triomphe from the summit of the Eiffel Tower The Gardens and Champs de Mars Surrounding the base of the Eiffel Tower are the Gardens, a nice place to go for a stroll and take a photo looking up at the Eiffel Tower. Champ de Mars is the park that sits beside the Eiffel Tower. It’s definitely worth the stroll as you get one of the best views of the Eiffel Tower from here. How to Get to the Eiffel Tower Bir-Hakeim, line 6, 11-minute walk; Ecole Militaire, line 8, 16-minute walk; Trocadero, line 9, 16-minute walk You can also get here by bus (line 82 and 42), by taxi or ride share app (like Uber), line C on the RER, or by boat. There are two entrances into the Esplanade of the Eiffel Tower. Entrance 1 is on the south corner and Entrance 2 is on the east corner. Entrance 2 tends to be a little less crowded, according to the official website. We entered through the east entrance and on both visits in early September, there was no line, both in the morning and evening. This entrance is a security entrance, not a ticketed entrance. You will go through airport style security. Once through the security check, you will enter the Esplanade. From here, you can get in line for the stairs or elevator (if you already purchased your ticket online in advance) or get in the ticket line. Eiffel Tower Tickets & How to Skip the Line There are four ticket types for the Eiffel Tower. Which one you choose depends on how many levels you want to visit and whether you want to take the stairs or elevator. Taking the stairs is cheaper and almost always has a shorter line. Second Floor Access via the Stairs: This is the cheapest option. Tickets cost €14.50. You will take the stairs to the first and second floors only. There are 327 steps to the first level and 347 steps to the second level. Second Floor Access via the Lift: €23.10; visit the first and second levels using the elevator Top Floor Access via the Lift: €36.10; elevator access for all 3 floors of the Eiffel Tower. Top Floor Access via Stairs and the Lift: €27.50; take the stairs to the first and second floors and ride the elevator to the third floor. The Paris Museum Pass is not accepted at the Eiffel Tower. How to Skip the Line at the Eiffel Tower To skip the ticket line, purchase you ticket online in advance on the With an online ticket, once you cross the first security check, you will get in line for the lift or the stairs, with no need to get into the ticket line. Tickets for the lift go on sale 60 days in advance and tickets for the stairs go on sale 14 days in advance. If you will be visiting Paris in June, July, August, and early September, plan on purchasing your tickets as soon as they become available. We were unable to get tickets online in advance (we attempted this 30 days before our visit in September), and since they were sold out, so then we took this tour to avoid the ticket line. However, once in Paris, lines were relatively light at the Eiffel Tower. We visited the Eiffel Tower at two different times of the day during the second week of September and there was less than a 10-minute wait in the ticket line. We have been getting a lot of comments that tickets are selling out as soon as they become available. For the best shot of getting a ticket from the official website, be ready to purchase your tickets the moment they become available, which is at midnight in Paris 60 days in advance. The Paris time zone is UTC/GMT + 2 hours. For more information, scroll down to the comment section and read the tips from John Williams. Thanks John! Summer is the busiest time to visit the Eiffel Tower (especially July and August), followed by holidays such as I highly recommend purchasing your tickets online in advance as soon as they become available for these time periods. In the shoulder and off season, if online tickets are sold out, you can take your chances that the line will be short, or join a tour, just to play it safe. If you couldn’t purchase your tickets online in advance and have no desire to take a tour, then book a reservation at Madame Brasserie. Your meal includes a ride on the lift to the restaurant, so you’ll bypass the ticket line. But it is important to know that with a ticket to Madame Brasserie, you are only permitted to visit the first floor of the Eiffel Tower (you will need to purchase a separate ticket to visit the 2nd or 3rd floor). Here is a basic timeline for a visit to the Eiffel Tower, from entering the Esplanade to visiting its multiple levels. The first thing you will do is to go through airport style security at the south or east entrances into the Esplanade. There are two lines here, one for visitors with tickets (green flag) and one for visitors without tickets. If you have a ticket, get here 15 minutes early (get here at 10:45 am for an 11:00 am ticket). If you don’t have a ticket, your wait could be as little as a few minutes to much longer during peak season. If you do not have a ticket for the Eiffel Tower, get in line to make your purchase. Again, your wait could be as little as a few minutes to as much as 2 hours during peak season. 3. Take the Lift or the Stairs If you have a ticket for the lift, get into line at the east or west pillars. If you will be taking the stairs, these are located on the south pillar. We’ve done both, the stairs and the lift. If you have the energy, the stairs tend to be a little bit faster, since there usually is no line. If you have a lift ticket, the lift skips the first level and goes directly to the second level. If you have a ticket to visit the third level, I recommend getting in line for this as soon as you reach the second level. Lines can be long and with the possibility of closure, it’s best to visit the 3rd level first (our tour guide also recommended this same plan of attack). 4. Time on the Eiffel Tower The amount of time you will spend on the Eiffel Tower can range quite a bit, depending on how many levels you visit, queues, and whether or not you plan to add on Madame Brasserie or Jules Verne. Most visits last 1 to 2 hours, which includes all 3 levels if lines are short (2 to 3 hours during peak season, especially if you plan to visit the third floor). Lunch or dinner at Madame Brasserie or Jules Verne adds another 2 hours. Take the lift or the stairs to the Esplanade. The exits are located on the west and north corners of the gardens. Once you are finished, here are a few things to do nearby: na to the Trocadero for an iconic view of the Eiffel Tower. Ride the carrousel located next to the Eiffel Tower (it is located between the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River). Take a stroll through Champ de Mars, the large green space next to the Eiffel Tower. It’s a short walk to Frame Restaurant & Bar, a restaurant with a view of the Eiffel Tower that serves great food and drinks. Walk to Rue Cler and put together a picnic lunch or dinner of bread, cheese, fruit, and charcuterie. Find an empty park bench on Champ de Mars and enjoy your cheap but delicious French meal with a view of the Eiffel Tower. The view of the Eiffel Tower from the Trocadéro at sunset Best Time to Visit the Eiffel Tower Visiting the Eiffel Tower is a wonderful experience from the time it opens in the morning until midnight. The best time to visit the Eiffel Tower is about one hour before sunset, so you can gaze out over Paris both as it is illuminated by the sun, but also get to see the lights twinkle on as the sun lowers across the sky. If you stay past sunset, you’ll be on the Eiffel Tower when its lights sparkle. We also like being on the Eiffel Tower midday, which is a great time to photograph the city from the tower. Skip the Line Tours of the Eiffel Tower If you are unable to get tickets online in advance, here are a few tours of the Eiffel Tower that get great reviews. One of the cheapest options is to purchase an entrance ticket via a third-party provider. which includes your entrance ticket and the option to add on the third level, is one of the tours that we took. We met our guide at Champs de Mars Café, walked to the Eiffel Tower in a small group, the guide accompanied us to the second level, and then we were on our own. This costs just a few euros more than the ticket on the official website, so it’s a great option if you don’t want to spend a lot of money but also want to avoid the wait in the ticket line. which is very similar to the one above. It’s a little more expensive but the guide did not waste any time getting us into the Esplanade and up to the second level. For that reason, I liked this one a little bit more. This is one of the highest reviewed tours of the Eiffel Tower. Visit the second level and/or summit with a guide on this 2-to-3-hour tour. includes a visit to the Eiffel Tower summit (third floor) and a Seine River Cruise. Interesting Facts about the Eiffel Tower The Eiffel Tower stands in Champs de Mars and is named after the engineer in charge of the project. It was constructed for the to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. When it was completed, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world. It held this title until 1930, with the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York City. The Eiffel Tower was only intended to stand for 20 years. However, it became such an important tourist site, and a valuable radiotelegraph station, that it was never dismantled. Now, the Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited monuments in the world and one of the most popular tourist attractions in Europe . In 2022, 5.9 million people visited the Eiffel Tower. In 1991, it was named as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site “Paris, Banks of the Seine.” The Eiffel Tower is repainted by hand every 7 years. Its color has changed over the years, and it was originally painted a reddish-brown color, then to a golden yellow in 1892, and then back to red in the mid-1900’s. It is being repainted again in preparation for the summer 2024 Olympics. Each night, the Eiffel Tower sparkles, with the twinkling of thousands of lights. The light show lasts for five minutes at each hour, starting at sunset. How long does a visit to the Eiffel Tower last?
